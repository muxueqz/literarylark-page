<p><em>A Devilish Blizzard Makes the Snow Whirl</em></p>
<p><em>The Monk Who Seeks to Worship Buddha Walks on Ice</em> The story tel s how the believers in Chen Vil age noisily carried Monkey and Pig with pork, mut on, beef and wine straight to the Temple of Miraculous Response, where they set them al out with the young boy and girl in the most prominent place. Monkey looked around and saw that the offertory tables were covered with fragrant flowers and wax candles. In front of him was a tablet on which were inscribed in let ers of gold, GREAT KING OF</p>
<p>MIRACULOUS RESPONSE. There were no statues of any other gods.</p>
<p>When the believers had set everything out properly they al kowtowed and made this prayer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great King, our lord, at this hour of this day of this month of this year Chen Cheng, the master of the sacrifice, and al the other faithful of different ages beg to offer in accordance with annual custom the lit le boy Chen Guan-given, the lit le girl Pan of Gold, pork, mut on, beef and wine for the delectation of the Great King. We beg you to give us the right amounts of wind and rain and to grant a good harvest for al our crops.&rdquo; After praying they burnt paper horses and al went home.</p>
<p>When they had al gone Pig said to Monkey, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your home?&rdquo; Monkey asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back to old Chen&rsquo;s place for a sleep,&rdquo; Pig replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking nonsense again, idiot,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made them a promise and now you&rsquo;ve got to fulfil their wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>750</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the idiot, not me, despite what you&rsquo;ve always saying,&rdquo; replied Pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t we just take him for a ride. You can&rsquo;t be serious about us being sacrificed for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always finish what you begin,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;We&rsquo;l only be able to tidy this business up if we stay here til the Great King comes to eat us up.</p>
<p>Otherwise we&rsquo;l make him cause disasters, which would be terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were talking they heard the howling of a wind outside. &ldquo;This is terrible,&rdquo; said Pig. &ldquo;What made the wind come?&rdquo; &quot;</p>
<p>Shut up,&quot; said Monkey, &ldquo;while I cope.&ldquo;Amoment later an evil creature came in through the temple doors. Look at him:</p>
<p>Gold armor, golden helmet, shining bright;</p>
<p>Red clouds enfold the jade belt at his waist.</p>
<p>His eyes were gleaming like the stars at night, His teeth resembled those on a pair of saws.</p>
<p>Under his feet wafted sunset clouds;</p>
<p>Warm and scented were the mists al around.</p>
<p>Cold blew the negative winds as he walked;</p>
<p>Heavy lay the air of death where he stood.</p>
<p>He was just like an officer guarding an emperor, Or a god at the gateway protecting a monastery.</p>
<p>The monster stood blocking the entrance to the temple and asked, &ldquo;Who is making the sacrifice this year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for asking,&rdquo; Monkey replied. &ldquo;This year the vil age heads are the family of Chen Cheng and Chen Qing.&rdquo; This reply struck the monster as very odd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy has a lot of courage,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and he&rsquo;s a good talker too.</p>
<p>Usual y the children who are offered say nothing the first time I ask them a question and are frightened out of their wits the second time. Before I&rsquo;ve even grabbed them in my hand they are already dead. So why&rsquo;s this boy today so good at answering?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of seizing him the monster asked another question: &ldquo;What is your name, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Chen Guan-given, and the girl is cal ed Pan of Gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to the old custom of this sacrifice I should eat you first,&rdquo; said the monster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no objection,&rdquo; said Brother Monkey. &ldquo;Enjoy your meal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>751</p>
<p>Hearing this the monster was once more afraid to grab Monkey, so instead he blocked the doorway and shouted, &ldquo;I&rsquo;l have none of your answering back.</p>
<p>Usual y I eat the boy first, but this year I shal start with the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bet er to fol ow the old custom,&rdquo; said Pig in a panic. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t break with tradition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without any more discussion the monster made a grab for Pig, who leapt down, turned back into himself, and struck at the monster&rsquo;s hand with his rake. The monster pul ed his hand back and fled.Al that could be heard was a mighty clang. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve smashed his armor,&rdquo; exclaimed Pig.</p>
<p>Monkey, who had resumed his own true form as wel , looked, saw two fish scales the size of an ice dish, and gave a shout of &ldquo;After him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two of them sprang up into the air, where the monster, who had come unarmed to his feast, asked them from a cloud, &ldquo;Where are you from, monks, and why have you come here to bul y me, spoil my offerings, and ruin my reputation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you don&rsquo;t realize, damned monster,&rdquo; Monkey replied, &ldquo;is that we are disciples of the holy priest Sanzang from Great Tang in the East who has been sent by his emperor to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven. We were spending last night at the Chen household when were told that an evil spirit pretending to be Miraculous Response demands the sacrifice of a boy and a girl every year. In our mercy we decided to save life and capture you, damned monster. You&rsquo;d bet er make a ful and true confession at once. How long have you been here cal ing yourself &lsquo;Great King,&lsquo;and at two a year how many lit le boys and girls have you eaten? Given me a ful account and return them to me if you want your life spared.&rdquo; At that the monster fled, avoiding another blow that Pig struck at him with his rake. He turned into a wild wind and went straight into the River of Heaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to chase him,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure the monster&rsquo;s a river creature. We&rsquo;l have to work out a way of catching him and get ing the master across the river tomorrow.&rdquo; Pig accepted this suggestion and went straight back to the temple, from where he carried the offerings of pork, mut on and wine, tables and al , back to the Chen house. The Tang Priest, Friar Sand and the Chen brothers were waiting for news in the hal when they saw Monkey and Pig burst in and put al the pork, mut on and other offerings in the courtyard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened in the sacrifice, Wukong?&rdquo; Sanzang asked Monkey, who 752</p>
<p>related how he had told the monster who he was and chased him into the river, to the immense delight of the two old gentlemen, who ordered that the side rooms were to be swept out and furnished with beds. Here the master and his disciples were invited to spend the night.</p>
<p>Having escaped with his life back to the river the monster sat brooding silently in his palace while his river clansmen asked him, &ldquo;Why are you so upset this year, Your Majesty? Usual y you are very happy when you come back from eating your sacrifice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In ordinary years I bring you back some left-overs after the sacrifice,&rdquo; said the monster, &ldquo;but I did not even have anything to eat myself today. My luck was out. I met enemies who al but kil ed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Your Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disciples of a holy priest from Great Tang in the East who is going to the Western Heaven to worship the Buddha and fetch the scriptures. They had turned themselves into a boy and a girl and were sit ing in my temple. When they turned back into themselves they almost kil ed me. I&rsquo;ve long heard people tel of Tang Sanzang, a holy man who has cultivated his conduct for ten lifetimes: one piece of his flesh wil make you immortal. But I never expected he would have disciples such as those. He&rsquo;s ruined my reputation and stopped them worshipping me any more. I wish I could capture that Tang Priest, but I don&rsquo;t think I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From among the watery tribe there slipped forward a female mandarin fish in pat erned clothes. She advanced with smal , respectful steps towards the monster, bowing frequently as she said, &ldquo;Your Majesty, there wil be no problem about catching the Tang Priest. But if you do capture him wil you reward me with a feast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have a plan we shal combine our efforts to catch the Tang Priest,&rdquo;</p>
<p>the monster said. &ldquo;I shal take you as my sworn sister, and we shal eat his flesh together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mandarin fish bowed in thanks then said, &ldquo;I have long known that Your Majesty has the powers to cal up wind and rain, or to throw rivers and sea into turmoil. But can you make it snow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the monster replied. &ldquo;As you can make it snow,&rdquo; the mandarin fish continued, &ldquo;can you also cause cold and make ice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m even bet er at that,&rdquo; the monster said. The fish then clapped her hands with delight and said, &ldquo;In that case it wil be very, very easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>753</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wil you tel me this very easy way of succeeding?&rdquo; the monster asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty must lose no time,&rdquo; the fish replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s now the third watch, about midnight. You must make magic to cause a cold wind and a heavy fal of snow at once. The River of Heaven must be frozen solid. Those of us who are good at transformations wil make ourselves look like people and appear at the end of the track with packs on our backs, carrying umbrel as and luggage poles and pushing carts. We shal walk across the ice in an endless stream. That Tang Priest is so impatient to fetch the scriptures that when he sees al those people walking along he&rsquo;s bound to want to cross the ice himself. Al Your Majesty needs to do is to sit quietly in the middle of the river until you hear his footsteps, then crack the ice apart so that he and his disciples al fal into the water. They&rsquo;l al be caught in one package.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvel ous, marvel ous,&rdquo; exclaimed the monster, who was ut erly delighted at the suggestion. He left his watery palace and went up into the sky, where he caused winds and snow, and made it so cold that the river froze.</p>
<p>The Tang Priest and his three disciples slept in the Chen house. Shortly before dawn they al began to feel very cold in their bedding. Pig was shivering, unable to get back to sleep, so he cal ed, &ldquo;Brother, it&rsquo;s cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot,&rdquo; said Monkey, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got no sense of how to behave. Monks are not affected by summer or winter. You shouldn&rsquo;t mind the cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disciple,&rdquo; said Sanzang, &ldquo;it real y is cold. Look: Double quilts now give no warmth,</p>
<p>Hands put in sleeves find only ice.</p>
<p>Strands of frost grow from withered leaves,</p>
<p>Frozen bel s hang from frozen pines.</p>
<p>The cold is so intense the earth splits open; The water in the pond is a solid block.</p>
<p>No old man can be seen in the fisherman&rsquo;s boat; No monk is to be met with in the mountain temple.</p>
<p>The woodman wishes he could gather more fuel; The prince is glad to pile more charcoal on the flames.</p>
<p>Travelers&rsquo; beards are turned to iron;</p>
<p>The poet&rsquo;s brush is water-chestnut hard.</p>
<p>Even a fur jacket now seems too thin;</p>
<p>A marten coat feels much too light.</p>
<p>The monk on his hassock is frozen rigid;</p>
<p>754</p>
<p>Behind the paper screen the traveler is scared.</p>
<p>Even in many a layer of bedding</p>
<p>One shivers and shakes from top to toe.</p>
<p>As neither master nor disciples could sleep they rose and dressed. When they opened the door to look outside they saw to their astonishment a vast expanse of white. It was snowing. &ldquo;No wonder we were so cold,&rdquo; said Monkey, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s been snowing so heavily.&rdquo; When the four of them looked they saw that it was a splendid fal :</p>
<p>Dark masses of cloud,</p>
<p>Chil ing, dreary mists.</p>
<p>Under dark masses of cloud</p>
<p>The North wind howls cold;</p>
<p>Through chil ing, dreary mists</p>
<p>A heavy snowfal blankets the ground.</p>
<p>Indeed:</p>
<p>The six-sided snowflakes</p>
<p>Are flying jewels;</p>
<p>In the great forest</p>
<p>Jade hangs from every tree.</p>
<p>First like flour, then like salt.</p>
<p>The white parrot loses its whiteness,</p>
<p>The crane&rsquo;s feathers no longer stand out.</p>
<p>It adds to the waters of a thousand rivers,</p>
<p>Outdoes the plum-trees in the Southeast.</p>
<p>As if three mil ion dragons of jade were defeated, The sky is fil ed with fragments of armor and scales.</p>
<p>Here you wil not find Dongguo&rsquo;s soleless sandals, The bed where Yuan An froze to death,</p>
<p>The place where Sun Kang studied in the snow&rsquo;s reflected light, The boat that Wang Ziyou took one snowy night, Wang Gong&rsquo;s cloak,</p>
<p>Or the rug that Su Wu had to eat.</p>
<p>Al you wil see are vil age houses set like inlaid silver, Three thousand miles of jade-like river and hil s.</p>
<p>What splendid snow,</p>
<p>Sprinkling the bridge with wil ow catkins,</p>
<p>755</p>
<p>Covering the cot age with pear blossom.</p>
<p>When the bridge is sprinkled with wil ow catkins, The fisherman beside it dons his cape of straw; When the cot age is covered with pear blossom The old man inside bums his firewood.</p>
<p>The traveler is hard put to it to buy a drink; The slave cannot find the plum blossom for which be is sent.</p>
<p>The heavy fal of snow takes off the but erfly&rsquo;s wings, The howling blizzard strips the goose of its feathers.</p>
<p>Rol ing drifts are blown by the winds;</p>
<p>Layer upon layer hides the road.</p>
<p>Freezing gusts come through the curtains,</p>
<p>A chil y wind blows into the bed.</p>
<p>This is Heaven&rsquo;s promise of a good harvest,</p>
<p>Good news that is cause for celebration.</p>
<p>The snow was fal ing in abundance like fragments of jade or cot on wool.</p>
<p>When master and disciples had sighed in admiration of it for a long time the two old Chen brothers told two servants to sweep a way through the snow and two more to bring the monks hot water with which to wash their faces.</p>
<p>Alit le later boiling hot tea, cheesecakes and a charcoal stove were al carried out to the side room, where master and disciple sat around them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Venerable benefactor,&rdquo; the Tang Priest asked, &ldquo;could you tel me if you distinguish between the seasons of the year here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may be a remote place,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;and our customs and people may be different from those in your distinguished land, but our crops and animals grow under the same sky, so of course we distinguish between the four seasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case why is there such heavy snow today, and why is it so cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanzang asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although it has been August,&rdquo; the old man replied, &ldquo;the frost last night marked the beginning of September. We general y have frost and snow here in September.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is different from the East,&rdquo; said Sanzang. &ldquo;We have frost and snow in the winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were talking servants came in with tables and invited them to take some porridge. By the time they had finished eating the snow was heavier 756</p>
<p>than ever and before long it lay two feet deep. Sanzang began to weep with anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t worry so,&rdquo; said old Mr. Chen, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t be upset because the snow is deep. We have plenty of grain here, enough to feed you venerable gentlemen for half a lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know why I am suffering, benefactor,&rdquo; Sanzang replied. &ldquo;When al those years ago His Majesty the Tang Emperor graciously commanded me to make this journey and escorted me in person by carriage to the frontier pass he offered me a parting meal with his own hands, asking me when I would be back. I did not realize how many difficult mountains and rivers would lie in my way, so I casual y replied that I could be back with the scriptures in three years. It is now already seven or eight years since I left and I have yet to gaze on the face of the Buddha. I am worried that I have exceeded His Majesty&rsquo;s time limit and afraid of al the evil monsters and other vicious creatures ahead. Today I have had the good fortune to stay in your great mansion, and last night my disciples were able to thank you by doing you a smal favour. I was hoping to ask for a boat to ferry us across the river, never expecting that Heaven would send this heavy fal of snow. Now the roads are blocked and I do not know when I shal complete my mission and return home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not worry, sir,&rdquo; said old Mr. Chen. &ldquo;Most of the time for your journey has already passed. You wil only have to wait here a few days for the skies to clear and the ice to melt, then we wil spend everything we have to see you across the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aservant then came in to invite them to breakfast, which they ate in the main hal , fol owed not long afterwards by lunch. Sanzang felt embarrassed by al this lavish hospitality, so he said repeatedly, &ldquo;As you are being so kind as to let us stay we must insist on eating more ordinary fare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Venerable sir,&rdquo; Mr. Chen replied, &ldquo;we are so grateful for having the children saved from the sacrifice that we could not thank you enough even if we gave you banquets every day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After this the snow stopped and people began to move around. Seeing how unhappy Sanzang was, old Mr. Chen had the garden swept and a fire made in a brazier, then invited them to the snow-cave to cheer themselves up by enjoying the snow view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a sil y idea,&rdquo; laughed Pig. &ldquo;Spring is the time for enjoying gardens.</p>
<p>757</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much too cold in al this snow, and anyhow there&rsquo;s nothing to be seen now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know anything, you idiot,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;Snowscapes are very peaceful and elegant. It wil be a pleasure to see them and it wil make the master feel bet er too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said old Mr. Chen. The visitors were then taken into the garden and this is what they saw:</p>
<p>Although it was autumn</p>
<p>The scenery was winter&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Jade stamens formed on the hoary pine,</p>
<p>Silvery flowers hung from the dying wil ow.</p>
<p>Powder was piled on the lichen by the steps,</p>
<p>Jeweled shoots sprang from the bamboo at the window.</p>
<p>The craggy mountain tops,</p>
<p>The fishpond.</p>
<p>On the craggy mountain tops</p>
<p>The sharp and pointed peaks were like jade bamboo.</p>
<p>In the fishpond</p>
<p>The clear and living water now was ice,</p>
<p>Gone was the beauty of the lotus by the bank; The rose of Sharon&rsquo;s delicate fronds hung low.</p>
<p>The autumn begonia</p>
<p>Was weighed right down;</p>
<p>The winter plum</p>
<p>Was just put ing out new growth.</p>
<p>The Peony Pavilion,</p>
<p>The Pomegranate Pavilion,</p>
<p>The Osmanthus Pavilion,</p>
<p>Al piled deep in goose-down;</p>
<p>The Place for Forget ing Cares,</p>
<p>The Place for Entertaining Visitors,</p>
<p>The Place for Recreation,</p>
<p>Al covered as if with but erflies&rsquo; wings.</p>
<p>The yel ow chrysanthemums by the fence were woven of jade and gold; A few maples were dappled white and red.</p>
<p>Many a courtyard was too cold to enter:</p>
<p>758</p>
<p>The sight of the snow-cave made one feel like ice.</p>
<p>Here was set a brazier of bronze,</p>
<p>With heads of animals and legs like elephants, Where a toasting-hot fire of charcoal burnt,</p>
<p>And some lacquered armchairs</p>
<p>With cushions of tigerskin</p>
<p>And screens of paper set al around for warmth.</p>
<p>On the wal s were hung ancient paintings by famous artists, showing: The Seven Worthies going out through the pass, A solitary fisherman on a cold river,</p>
<p>Amid a landscape of snowy peaks and mountains.</p>
<p>Su Wu eating his rug,</p>
<p>Breaking off plum branches to meet the envoys, And writing in the cold of a frozen forest.</p>
<p>There was no end of</p>
<p>Houses near a river pavilion where fish can be bought, Mountain tracks buried in snow where no wine is on sale.</p>
<p>Were it big enough to live in</p>
<p>Who would need to go to magical Penghu?</p>
<p>After they had admired the scenery for a long time they sat down in the snow-cave and told the elderly neighbors about their mission to fetch the scriptures.</p>
<p>When they had drunk the fragrant tea old Mr. Chen said, &ldquo;Venerable gentlemen, may I offer you some wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a monk I do not drink,&rdquo; replied Sanzang, &ldquo;but my disciples may drink a few cups.&rdquo; The old man was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring vegetarian food,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and warm some wine to keep the cold out of these gentlemen.&rdquo; Servants then carried out tables that were set round the brazier. They al drank several cups with the two elderly neighbors, then everything was tidied away.</p>
<p>By now it was get ing late, and the visitors were invited back into the hal for an evening meal. They could hear passers-by in the street saying, &ldquo;Oh! It&rsquo;s cold today. The River of Heaven is frozen solid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible,&rdquo; said Sanzang to Brother Monkey. &ldquo;The river&rsquo;s frozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a sudden cold snap like this I think that only the shal ow water near the bank can have frozen,&rdquo; said old Mr. Chen. Then another passer-by said, &ldquo;The whole 250 miles of it are frozen as smooth as a mirror, and some people are 759</p>
<p>set ing out across it from where the road ends.&rdquo; Hearing that people were walking across, Sanzang wanted to go out and take a look. &ldquo;Do not be in such a hurry, venerable sir,&rdquo; said old Mr. Chen. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s late now. Wait til morning.&rdquo; He then said good-bye to the two elderly neighbors, and after supper the visitors slept in the side room once more.</p>
<p>Pig rose at dawn and said, &ldquo;Brother, it was even colder last night. I think the river real y must have frozen solid.&rdquo; Sanzang went to the door, bowed low to Heaven, and prayed, &ldquo;Al you gods who protect the teachings, on my journey West I have faithful y worshipped the Buddha and crossed many a river and mountain with great suffering and never a word of complaint. I am deeply grateful for Heaven&rsquo;s help in bringing me this far, and I also give most humble thanks that the river has now frozen. When I bring the scriptures back I shal report al this to the Tang Emperor and reward you sincerely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had finished his prayer he told Friar Sand to saddle the horse so that they could cross the river while it was frozen. &ldquo;Please do not be in such a hurry,&rdquo; said old Mr. Chen. &ldquo;Stay here a few more days until the ice has melted and I shal arrange for a boat to carry you across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether we should go or stay,&rdquo; said Friar Sand. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t rely on what people say, and you can only believe what you see with your own eyes. I&rsquo;l saddle the horse and you can take a look for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agood suggestion,&rdquo; said old Mr. Chen. &ldquo;Servants,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;saddle six of our horses, but not the Tang Priest&rsquo;s horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then with six young pages in at endance they went in line to the bank of the river to look. Indeed:</p>
<p>The snow is piled up like mountains,</p>
<p>When the clouds disappear the dawn is bright.</p>
<p>A thousand pinnacles soar above the ice-locked pass; Frozen rivers and lakes are completely smooth.</p>
<p>The North wind chil s to the bone,</p>
<p>The slippery ice is bit erly cold.</p>
<p>The fish stay by the plants in the pond,</p>
<p>The wild birds linger in the stubble.</p>
<p>Beyond the frontier fingers are lost to frostbite; The boatman on the river breaks his teeth with shivering.</p>
<p>Snakes&rsquo; stomachs split,</p>
<p>Birds&rsquo; legs break:</p>
<p>760</p>
<p>The ice forms mountains thousands of feet high.</p>
<p>The flowing silver stops in ten thousand val eys; Cold is the river&rsquo;s liquid jade.</p>
<p>The East produces frozen silkworms,</p>
<p>And mice make their holes in the Northern ice.</p>
<p>Wang Xiang lay on the ice to melt it</p>
<p>And caught a carp for his mother to eat.</p>
<p>When the Emperor Guangwu crossed the river</p>
<p>A bridge of ice formed overnight for him.</p>
<p>Many are the layers of ice on the pond,</p>
<p>And the deep pool is frozen solid.</p>
<p>There are no more waves on the mighty River of Heaven; The gleaming ice stretches out as hard as a road.</p>
<p>When Sanzang and his party reached the bank of the river they reined in their horses to look and saw that there real y were people set ing out from where the road reached the bank. &ldquo;Benefactor,&rdquo; asked Sanzang, &ldquo;where are those people going to across the ice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the other side of the river,&rdquo; said old Mr. Chen, &ldquo;is the Womanland of Western Liang. Those people are al traders. What costs a hundred cash on this side can be worth ten thousand over there and vice versa, and it&rsquo;s because such big profits can be made for such a smal expenditure that people risk their lives to go there. Normal y they form groups of five to a dozen or so and sail across, but now that the river has frozen over they are prepared to walk over at mortal peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fame and profit are what make the world go round,&rdquo; said Sanzang. &ldquo;They are risking their lives for profit, and my disciples loyal y obey orders for the sake of fame: there&rsquo;s not much to choose between them.&rdquo; He then told Monkey to go back to their benefactors&rsquo;house, pack the luggage, and bridle and saddle the horse so that they could head West while the ice held. Monkey agreed with a chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Friar Sand, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a saying that goes, &lsquo;For a thousand days you need a thousand pints of rice.&lsquo;Now that we are staying at the Chen house why don&rsquo;t we wait here a few days longer til the skies have cleared and the ice melted then get a boat to take us across? Rushing like this wil only lead to trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wujing,&rdquo; Sanzang replied, &ldquo;how can you be so stupid? If it were March and 761</p>
<p>the weather were warming up every day we could wait for it to thaw. But now it is September and it is get ing cooler very day, so it would be absurd to wait for the thaw. It would set our journey a long time back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop al that idle chat er,&rdquo; said Pig, jumping down from his horse. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find out how thick the ice is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You idiot,&rdquo; said Monkey, &ldquo;you could test the depth of the water the other evening by throwing a stone into it, but you could never do that now that the ice is so thick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you don&rsquo;t understand, brother,&rdquo; said Pig, &ldquo;is that I can hit it with my rake. If I smash through it, it&rsquo;s too thin for us to walk on; but if I don&rsquo;t move it at al that&rsquo;l show it&rsquo;s thick enough for us to cross.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say is right,&rdquo; observed Sanzang. The idiot hitched up his clothes, strode to the edge of the river, raised his rake with both hands, and brought it down with al his might. There was a hol ow thump as nine white scars appeared on the ice. His hand had been painful y jarred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can go,&rdquo; said the idiot with a grin, &ldquo;we can go. It&rsquo;s frozen solid right down to the bot om.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news delighted Sanzang, who took them al back to the Chen house and told them to prepare to travel. Seeing that repeated pleas were not going to make their visitors stay the two old men gave them some dry cooked grain, buns and steamed bread. The whole household kowtowed to the monks in respect then carried out a tray of silver and gold pieces and knelt before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are so grateful to you gentlemen for saving the lives of our children that we would like to offer you this towards the cost of a meal on the journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanzang shook his head and waved his hand as he refused to accept it. &ldquo;I am a monk,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and what would I want with money? I would never be able to produce it on the journey. We have to beg for what we eat. The food you have given us wil be plenty.&rdquo; When the old men repeatedly implored them to accept it Monkey took just under half an ounce of it between his fingers that he handed to Sanzang with the words, &ldquo;Master, accept this offering so as not to be ungrateful to the two old gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only then did they take their leave. Once the horse&rsquo;s hoofs slipped on the ice at the edge of the river, so that Sanzang almost fel of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard going, Master,&rdquo; said Friar Sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Pig. &ldquo;Ask old Mr. Chen for some rice straw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; Brother Monkey asked.</p>
<p>762</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Pig. &ldquo;If you wrap rice straw round the horse&rsquo;s hoofs it won&rsquo;t slip and the master won&rsquo;t fal off.&rdquo; When old Mr. Chen heard this from the bank he at once sent someone back to fetch a bundle of rice straw from the house, then invited Sanzang to dismount while Pig wrapped the straw round the horse&rsquo;s hoofs, after which they set out across the ice.</p>
<p>When they had taken their leave of the old Chen brothers and gone a mile or so from the bank Pig handed the nine-ringed monastic staff to Sanzang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;hold this staff sticking out sideways as you ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You idiot,&rdquo; said Monkey, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re trying another dirty trick. You&rsquo;re meant to be carrying the staff, so why are you giving it to the master to carry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve never walked across ice,&rdquo; said Pig, &ldquo;so you wouldn&rsquo;t know that there are always crevasses. Step on one and you&rsquo;l go in. If you don&rsquo;t have something like a carrying-pole sticking out sideways then you&rsquo;l fal into the water and have no more chance of climbing out that if you were in a big pot with a lid on it. You&rsquo;ve got to have a prop like this to be safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This idiot must have years of experience of walking on ice,&rdquo; thought Monkey, smiling to himself, and they took Pig&rsquo;s advice: the venerable elder held his monastic staff sideways, Monkey his iron cudgel, Friar Sand his demon-quel ing staff and Pig, who had the luggage on a carrying-pole over his shoulder, held his rake sideways at waist height. Thus master and disciples pressed ahead without worry until nightfal , when they ate some of their dry rations. Not daring to delay, they hurried on over the ice that glistened and reflected the light of the moon and the stars across its white expanses. The horse never rested for a moment nor did master and disciples close their eyes as they kept going al night. They ate some more dry rations at dawn and pressed on towards the West.</p>
<p>As they were walking they heard a loud creaking noise from under the ice which so frightened the white horse that it almost fel over. &ldquo;Disciples,&rdquo; asked Sanzang with horror, &ldquo;what was that noise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The river has frozen so solid that it&rsquo;s made the earth rumble,&rdquo; said Pig. &ldquo;Or perhaps the river&rsquo;s frozen right to the bot om here in the middle.&rdquo; Half reassured but stil half terrified, Sanzang whipped the horse forward and they carried on.</p>
<p>Since coming back to his watery palace the evil monster had been waiting under the ice with al his spirits for a long time. As soon as he heard the horse&rsquo;s hoofs he used his magic to make the ice burst noisily open, giving 763</p>
<p>Monkey such a fright that he sprang up into mid-air. The other three and the white horse sank into the water, where the evil monster captured Sanzang and took him back to his underwater palace with al his spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is my sister the mandarin fish?&rdquo; he shouted stridently, at which she came forward, did obeisance, and said, &ldquo;Your Majesty, I am not worthy to be your sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you say such a thing, good sister?&rdquo; the monster replied. &ldquo;Once a word is spoken a four-horse chariot can&rsquo;t bring it back. I said that if I caught the Tang Priest by fol owing your plan I would take you as my sworn sister.</p>
<p>Today your plan has proved itself to have been a superb one and the Tang Priest has been caught. I could not possibly go back on my word. Lit le ones,&rdquo;</p>
<p>he ordered his underlings, &ldquo;bring a table, whet a sharp knife, open this monk up, cut out his heart, skin him, and slice up his flesh. I also want music played while I share him with my sister and we both obtain eternal life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the mandarin fish, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t eat him yet. His disciples may make trouble if they come here searching for him. It would be bet er to wait a couple of days until we know those damned wretches won&rsquo;t come looking for him before we cut him up. Then Your Majesty wil sit in the place of honour while we, your kinsfolk, play music, sing and dance around you and wait on you; and you wil be able to take your pleasure at your ease. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be best?&rdquo; The monster accepted the suggestion and had Sanzang stored away in a six-foot-long stone chest behind the palace.</p>
<p>Pig and Friar Sand meanwhile recovered the luggage in the river, loaded it on the back of the white horse, and swam up through the waves as they parted the waters. When Monkey saw them from up in the air he asked, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not the Tang Priest now,&rdquo; said Pig. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the Drowned Priest. We can&rsquo;t find him anywhere, so let&rsquo;s go back ashore and decide what to do.&rdquo; Now Pig was a mortal incarnation of Marshal Tian Peng who had once commanded eighty thousand sailors on the Heavenly River in the sky, Friar Sand had come from the Flowing Sands River, and the white horse was the grandson of the Dragon King of the Western Ocean, so they were al good swimmers.</p>
<p>With the Great Sage showing them the way from mid-air they were soon back at the Eastern bank, where they dried and brushed the horse and wrung out their clothes.</p>
<p>Monkey then landed his cloud, and they went back together to the Chen 764</p>
<p>household, where a messenger had already reported that only three of the four venerable gentlemen who were going to fetch the scriptures were now returning. The two aged brothers hurried outside to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; they said, seeing their wet clothes, &ldquo;we tried so hard to persuade you to stay longer, and look what has come of your refusal. Where is the venerable Tang Priest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He isn&rsquo;t the Tang Priest any more,&rdquo; said Pig. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the Drowned Priest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, alas,&rdquo; said the aged brothers, bursting into tears. &ldquo;We said that you should wait until the snow had melted and we could send you al across in a boat, but he refused to agree, and now he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old men,&rdquo; said Monkey, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t upset yourselves over your friend. I can assure you that the master wil not die. I&rsquo;m certain that the Great King of Miraculous Response has captured him by magic. So stop worrying, have our clothes washed and starched, our passport dried out, and the white horse fed. My brothers and I wil find the damned creature, rescue the master, and wipe this evil monster out. Then he&rsquo;l give you vil age no more trouble and you wil , I hope, have a safe and peaceful future.&rdquo; Old Mr. Chen, greatly encouraged to hear this, ordered a vegetarian meal to be provided.</p>
<p>The three brothers ate their fil , handed the horse and the luggage over to the care of the Chen household, got their weapons ready, and hurried off to find their master and catch the monster. Indeed:</p>
<p>The true nature was harmed by treading on the ice; How could they be complete without the Cinnabar?</p>
<p>If you do not know how they rescued the Tang Priest listen to the explanation in the next instal ment.</p>
