<p><em>When the Ape and the Horse Are Tamed They Cast Of Their Husks</em> <em>When Al the Deeds Have Been Done Reality Is Seen</em> The story told how after coming back to life Mr. Kou once more arranged for parasols, banners, drummers, musicians, Buddhist monks, Taoist priests, his friends and his relations to see Sanzang off again. But instead of describing this we wil tel of the Tang Priest and his three disciples taking the main road. The West was indeed a land of the Buddha, unlike anywhere else. They saw precious flowers, rare grasses, ancient cypresses and hoary pines. In al the places they passed through every family was pious and fed monks. Under every mountain people cultivated their conduct; in al the forests travelers recited sutras Master and disciples took shelter each night and set out at dawn, til six or seven days later a mass of high buildings and splendid hal s suddenly came into view. Truly they were:</p>
<p>Thrusting a hundred feet into the heavens,</p>
<p>Touching the Milky Way in the sky.</p>
<p>Lower your head and see the set ing sun;</p>

<p>Put out your hand and pluck a shooting star.</p>
<p>The spacious windows enclose the cosmos;</p>
<p>The towering roofbeams join up with the clouds.</p>
<p>Yel ow cranes bring let ers as the autumn trees grow old; Coloured phoenix epistles come in the fresh evening breeze.</p>
<p>These are sacred and precious palaces and gates, Jeweled, intricate buildings and courtyards.</p>
<p>In the holy hal s the Way is discussed;</p>
<p>Sutras are transmit ed throughout the universe.</p>
<p>The flowers are beautiful as they turn towards the spring; Green are the pine trees in the rain.</p>
<p>Purple fungus and immortals&rsquo; fruits ever flourish; Al beings respond as red phoenixes soar.</p>
<p>Sanzang raised his whip and pointed with it as he said, &ldquo;What a fine place, Wukong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Monkey, &ldquo;when you were in those delusive places where you saw false images of Buddhas you insisted on prostrating yourself in front of them. But today, when you&rsquo;ve reached the real place where there is the true image of the Buddha, you won&rsquo;t even dismount. What do you mean by it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner did he hear this than Sanzang sprang straight out of the saddle and went to the gateway.</p>
<p>A young lay brother who stood to one side of the monastery gateway cal ed out, &ldquo;You must be the people from the East who have come to fetch the scriptures.&rdquo; The venerable elder quickly straightened his clothes and raised his head to look around. He saw that the boy was Wearing clothes of golden brocade,</p>
<p>Waving a jade-handled whisk.</p>
<p>Wearing clothes of golden brocade</p>
<p>He feasted in pavilions by the Jasper Pool;</p>
<p>Waving a jade-handled whisk</p>
<p>He dusted the steps of the purple palaces.</p>
<p>At his side hung an immortal&rsquo;s tablet;</p>
<p>And on his feet were sandals.</p>
<p>He was a true winged adept,</p>
<p>Elegant and remarkable.</p>
<p>Having won immortality he lived in a wonderful land, 1547</p>
<p>Cultivating eternal life and escaping from worldly dust.</p>
<p>The holy priest did not recognize the stranger on Vulture Peak, The Gold-crested Immortal of yesteryear.</p>
<p>The Great Sage Monkey did, however, recognize him. &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Monkey, &ldquo;this is the Great Gold-crested Immortal who lives at the Jade Truth Temple at the foot of Vulture Peak. He is here to greet us.&rdquo; Only then did Sanzang realize who he was and step forward to salute him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have final y arrived here this year,&rdquo; replied the Great Immortal with a smile. &ldquo;I was fooled by the Bodhisat va Guanyin. Ten years ago she went to the East at the Buddha&rsquo;s command to find the Pilgrim who would fetch the scriptures. She told me then he would be here within two or three years. I have been waiting for years on end with no news of you at al . I never thought that it would be this year before we met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Put ing his hands together in front of his chest, Sanzang replied, &ldquo;I am very grateful to you for your kindness, Great Immortal, very grateful.&rdquo; Sanzang and his three disciples led the horse and carried the baggage with them into the Taoist temple, where they were introduced to al the Great Immortals there. Tea and a vegetarian meal were then ordered, and the Taoist boys were told to heat scented water for the holy monks to bathe in before climbing to the Buddha land. Indeed:</p>
<p>When achievements are complete it is right to bathe; The fundamental nature has been trained into innate truth.</p>
<p>Many thousand troubles and today:</p>
<p>The nine prohibitions and triple surrender lead to renewal.</p>
<p>The monsters al done with, they climb to the Buddha land; With disasters ended they see the Sramana.</p>
<p>Dirt and filth now washed away, they are whol y pure; Returning to the fundamental, their bodies are imperishable.</p>
<p>By the time master and disciples had bathed the day was drawing to a close.</p>
<p>They spent the night in the Jade Truth Temple.</p>
<p>The next morning the Tang Priest changed into his brocade cassock, put on his Vairocana mitre and grasped his monastic staff in his hand to climb the steps of the main hal and take his leave of the Great Immortal. &ldquo;Yesterday you were in rags,&rdquo; the Great Immortal said with a smile, &ldquo;but today you are dressed in splendor. I can see from your appearance that you are indeed a son of the Buddha.&rdquo; Sanzang then bowed in farewel .</p>
<p>1548</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; the Great Immortal said. &ldquo;I wil see you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to see us off,&rdquo; Monkey replied. &ldquo;I know the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you know,&rdquo; said the Great Immortal, &ldquo;is the way by cloud. The holy monk has never gone by cloud. He must go by the overland way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; replied Monkey. &ldquo;Although I&rsquo;ve been here several times I&rsquo;ve always come and gone by cloud. I&rsquo;ve never come here on foot. If there&rsquo;s an overland route I&rsquo;l trouble you to see us along it. My master is very serious about worshipping the Buddha, so I&rsquo;d be very grateful if you could hurry up about it.&rdquo; The Great Immortal chuckled as he took the Tang Priest by hand and led the Incense to the gate of the Dharma. The way led not out by the temple&rsquo;s front entrance but through the main hal and out through the back gate.</p>
<p>Pointing towards Vulture Peak, the Great Immortal said, &ldquo;Holy monk, do you see the auspicious light of many colours and the richly textured aura in the sky? That is the summit of Vulture Peak, the holy territory of the Lord Buddha.&rdquo; As soon as he saw it the Tang Priest bowed low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said Brother Monkey with a smile, &ldquo;we haven&rsquo;t got to the place for bowing yet. As the saying goes, &lsquo;The mountain may be in view, but your horse wil col apse before you get there.&rsquo; We&rsquo;re stil quite a long way from the place, so why start bowing now? If you bow al the way from here to the top, however many times wil you have to hit your head on the ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy monk,&rdquo; said the Great Immortal, &ldquo;You, the Great Sage, Marshal Tian Peng, and the Curtain-raising General have now reached the blessed land and seen Vulture Peak. I am going back now.&rdquo; Sanzang took his leave of the Great Immortal and continued on his way.</p>
<p>The Great Sage led the Tang Priest and the others slowly up Vulture Peak.</p>
<p>Within a couple of miles they reached a river of mighty rol ing waves some three miles wide. There was no sign of anyone anywhere around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wukong,&rdquo; said Sanzang with alarm, &ldquo;we have come the wrong way. I wonder if the Great Immortal misdirected us. This river is so wide and the waves so big, and there are no boats to be seen. How are we to cross it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t send us the wrong way,&rdquo; replied Monkey with a smile. &ldquo;Look over there. That&rsquo;s a bridge, isn&rsquo;t it? Once we&rsquo;re over that we&rsquo;l have completed the true achievement.&rdquo; When the venerable elder and the others went closer to look they saw a tablet beside it on which were writ en the words CLOUDTOUCHING CROSSING. Now this bridge was only a single 1549</p>
<p>log. Indeed:</p>
<p>From afar it seemed to span the void like a beam of jade; Seen closer, the bridge was but a withered spar crossing the water.</p>
<p>To bind a river and frame the sea is easier</p>
<p>Than walking along the trunk of a single tree.</p>
<p>The glow of a myriad rainbows spread out al around; A thousand lengths of fine white silk stretched to the edge of the sky.</p>
<p>It was narrow, slippery and hard to cross,</p>
<p>Unless one was a god who could walk on coloured clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wukong,&rdquo; said Sanzang in fear and trembling, &ldquo;no mortal man could cross that bridge. Let us look elsewhere to find the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is the way,&rdquo; replied Monkey with a smile, &ldquo;this is the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody&rsquo;s going to dare cross that even if it is the right way,&rdquo; said Pig with alarm. &ldquo;The river&rsquo;s so wide, and there are those terrible waves, and al there is is that narrow, slippery tree-trunk. We couldn&rsquo;t take a single step.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You al stand there while I go on it to show you,&rdquo; replied Monkey.</p>
<p>The splendid Great Sage strode forward and sprang on the single-trunk bridge. He quickly ran across to the other side, swaying as he went, and cal ed out, &ldquo;Come over, come over.&rdquo; The Tang Priest waved in refusal, while Pig and Friar Sand bit their fingers and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much too hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey then ran back again from the far side and pul ed at Pig. &ldquo;Come with me, you idiot,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;come with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too slippery, it&rsquo;s too slippery,&rdquo; said Pig, lying down on the ground. &ldquo;I could never cross it. Please spare me that and let me cross by wind and mist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey held him down as he replied, &ldquo;This is no place for you to be al owed to go riding wind and mist. You can only become a Buddha by crossing this bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Pig, &ldquo;I&rsquo;l never make it. Honestly, I can&rsquo;t walk across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the two of them were pul ing at each other and fighting, Friar Sand went over to talk them round. Only then did they let go of each other. Sanzang then looked round to see a man poling a boat towards them from downriver and shouting, &ldquo;Ferry! Come aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop fooling around, disciples,&rdquo; said a delighted venerable elder. &ldquo;There is a ferry-boat coming.&rdquo; The other three sprang to their feet and al watched together as the boat drew closer. It was a bot omless craft.</p>
<p>Monkey had already spot ed with the golden pupils in his fiery eyes that this 1550</p>
<p>was the Welcoming Lord Buddha, who is also known as Ratnadhvaja, the Royal Buddha of Brightness, but instead of giving this away he just kept cal ing, &ldquo;Over here, punt, over here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment later the ferryman had punted his boat up to the bank and was again shouting, &ldquo;Ferry! Come aboard!&rdquo; Sanzang was once more alarmed at the sight. &ldquo;Your boat has no bot om,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;so however could you ferry anyone across?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This boat of mine,&rdquo; the Buddha said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has been famous since Chaos was first divided, And been punted by me without any changes.</p>
<p>It is stable in wind and stable in waves,</p>
<p>Enjoying great peace with no start and no end.</p>
<p>Untouched by the six types of dust, it returns to the One, Carries on calmly through al kinds of calamity.</p>
<p>Hard it is for a bot omless boat to cross the oceans, But since ancient times it has ferried al creatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Great Sage Monkey put his hands together in front of his chest and thanked him with the words, &ldquo;I am grateful to you for your generosity in coming to welcome my master. Step aboard, Master. That boat of his may have no bot om, but it&rsquo;s stable, and won&rsquo;t capsize even in wind and waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The venerable elder was stil very doubtful, but Monkey seized him by the arms and pushed him forward. Unable to keep on his feet, the master tumbled into the water, where the ferryman grabbed hold of him at once and stood him on the boat. The master shook his clothes and stamped his feet, complaining about Monkey, who led Friar Sand and Pig to stand on board bringing the luggage and the horse with them.</p>
<p>Gently and strongly the Buddha pushed off, at which a corpse came floating downstream, to the horror of the venerable elder. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, Master,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, it&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; said Pig. Friar Sand clapped his hands as he said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boatman gave a cal , then also put in, too, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s you! Congratulations!</p>
<p>Congratulations!&rdquo; The three of them al joined in these congratulations as the ferryman punted the boat quickly and steadily over the immortal Cloud-touching Crossing. Sanzang turned around and sprang lightly ashore on the opposite bank. There is a poem about this that goes: 1551</p>
<p>When the womb-born flesh and body of blood is cast aside, The primal spirit finds kinship and love.</p>
<p>On this morning of actions completed and Buddhahood at ained The thirty-six kinds of dust from the past are washed away.</p>
<p>This was indeed what is meant by great wisdom, the boundless dharma of crossing to the other bank. When the four of them climbed the bank and looked back the bot omless boat had already disappeared, goodness knew where. Only when Brother Monkey explained that it had been the Welcoming Buddha did Sanzang find enlightenmentAt once he turned round to thank his three disciples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s not exchange thanks,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve helped each other. You saved us three, Master, and showed us the way to win merit so as to complete the true achievement. And we have protected you, Master, holding to the faith and helping you happily to cast off your mortal body. Master, look at the magnificent scenery ahead. Flowers, grasses, pines and bamboo, as wel as phoenixes, cranes and deer. Compare it with those places where evil beings created il usions through transformation.Ask yourself which is beautiful and good, and which ugly and evil.&rdquo; Sanzang was ful of expressions of gratitude.</p>
<p>Al of them were now light of body and cheerful as they walked up Vulture Peak. Soon the ancient Thunder Monastery could be seen: Its rooftops touched the heavens,</p>
<p>Its roots joined with the Sumeru range.</p>
<p>Amazing peaks spread out in serried rank;</p>
<p>Craggy rocks formed interlocking shapes.</p>
<p>Under the hanging scar were wonderful plants and flowers; Beside the winding path grew magic mushrooms and orchids.</p>
<p>Immortal apes were picking the fruit of the peach trees, Like gold amid burning flames;</p>
<p>White cranes perched in the branches of the pines As if they were jade creatures amid smoke.</p>
<p>Coloured phoenixes in pairs,</p>
<p>Green phoenixes two by two.</p>
<p>The pairs of coloured phoenixes</p>
<p>Brought blessings on the world as they cal ed to the sun; The green phoenixes two by two</p>
<p>Danced in the wind, a rare and wonderful sight.</p>
<p>1552</p>
<p>On the gleaming golden tiles were figures of mandarin ducks; The bril iantly pat erned bricks were set with agate.</p>
<p>To East and West</p>
<p>Were flowers of palaces and pearls of gateways; To North and South</p>
<p>Were endless precious pavilions and high buildings.</p>
<p>The Devaraja Hal streamed with coloured light; Purple flames rose before the Lokapalas Chamber.</p>
<p>Stupas stood out,</p>
<p>And fragrant were the blossoms of the udumbara tree.</p>
<p>Truly this was a place so fine it might have come from heaven, Where the days seemed long under leisurely clouds.</p>
<p>Away from the mortal world, al fates came to an end; Al kalpas were complete within the Dharma hal .</p>
<p>As master and disciples walked freely and at their ease up to the summit of Vulture Peak lay people could be seen under the green pines, and pious men and women amid the jade-coloured cypresses. The venerable elder bowed to them politely, whereupon al the lay men and women, monks and nuns al hastened to put their hands together and say to him, &ldquo;Do not bow to us, holy monk. Come back and talk with us when you have seen Sakyamuni.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit early for that,&rdquo; replied Monkey with a grin. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and worship the boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The venerable elder waved his arms and performed a ritual dance as he fol owed Monkey straight to the gates of the Thunder Monastery, where four great vajrapanis greeted them with the words, &ldquo;Have you arrived now, holy monk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Sanzang replied with a bow, &ldquo;Your disciple Xuanzang has arrived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having given this reply he was about to go in through the gateway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please wait for a moment, holy monk,&rdquo; the vajrapanis said. &ldquo;Let us report before you come in.&rdquo; The vajrapanis sent a report of the Tang Priest&rsquo;s arrival to the four great vajrapanis on the middle gates, who in turn reported it to the inner gates, inside which were divine monks making offerings.</p>
<p>As soon as they heard of the Tang Priest&rsquo;s arrival they al hurried to the Mahavira Hal , where they announced to the Tathagata Sakyamuni Buddha,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The holy monk from the Tang Court has arrived at your noble monastery to fetch the scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1553</p>
<p>The Lord Buddha was very pleased. He cal ed together his Eight Bodhisat vas, Four Vajrapanis, Five Hundred Arhats, Three Thousand Protectors, Eleven Heavenly Shiners and Eighteen Guardians, who drew themselves up in two lines and passed on the Buddha&rsquo;s command summoning the Tang Priest to enter. Thus it was that the invitation was sent down from one level to the next: &ldquo;Let the holy monk come in.&rdquo; Observing the requirements of ritual, the Tang Priest went in through the gate with Wukong and Wujing, who were leading the horse and carrying the luggage.</p>
<p>Indeed:</p>
<p>In the past he had struggled to fulfil his commission After leaving the emperor at the steps of the throne.</p>
<p>At dawn he had climbed mountains in mist and in dew; At dusk he had slept on rocks amid the clouds.</p>
<p>He had carried his stick across three thousand rivers, And climbed up countless crags with his monastic staff.</p>
<p>His every thought had been set on the true achievement, And today he was final y to see the Tathagata.</p>
<p>As the four of them arrived in front of the Mahavira Hal they al prostrated themselves and kowtowed to the Tathagata, then to their left and right. After they had each completed three rounds of Worship they then knelt before the Buddha to present their passport. When the Tathagata had read it careful y he handed it back to Sanzang, who bowed his head low and reported, &ldquo;Your disciple Xuanzang has made the long journey to your precious monastery at the command of the Great Tang emperor to beg for the true scriptures that wil save al living beings. I implore the Lord Buddha in his goodness to grant them at once so that I may return to my country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tathagata then opened his compassionate mouth and in the great mercy of his heart said to Sanzang, &ldquo;Your Eastern land is in the Southern Continent of Jambu. As the sky is lofty there, the soil deep, its products many, and the people multitudinous there is much covetous-ness, murder, debauchery, lying, deception and dishonesty. They do not fol ow the Buddhist teaching, do not turn towards good destinies, and do not honour the sun, moon and stars or value the five grains. They are not loyal, filial, righteous or kind. In the delusion of their hearts they mislead themselves, cheating on weights and measures, taking life and kil ing animals, thus creating such boundless evil karma and such a superabundance of sin and evil that they bring the 1554</p>
<p>catastrophe of hel on themselves. That is why they must fal for ever into the dark underworld to suffer the torments of being hammered, smashed, ground and pounded, or are reborn as animals. Many of them take the shape of furry, horned creatures to pay back the debts they owe from earlier lives and feed others with their own flesh. It is for such reasons that some fal into theAvici Hel , from which they never emerge to be reborn. Although Confucius established the doctrine of benevolence, righteousness, correct behavior and wisdom, and although successive emperors have applied the penalties of imprisonment, exile strangulation and beheading, none of this affected those stupid, benighted, self-indulgent and unrestrained people. Why? I have Three Stores of scriptures that offer deliverance from suffering and release from disaster. Of these Three Stores one is the Store of Dharma that deals with Heaven; one is the Store of Sastras that deal with the Earth, and one is the Store of Sutras that can save ghosts. There are thirty-five scriptures altogether, in 15,144 scrol s. These are indeed the path to the truth, the gateway to goodness. They include everything about the astronomy, geography, personalities, birds beasts trees, flowers, objects of use and human affairs of the world&rsquo;s four continents. Now that you have come from afar I would present them al to you to take away with you, but the people of your country are stupid and coarse. They are slanderers of the truth who cannot understand the mysteries of our teachings. Ananda, Kasyapa,&rdquo; he cal ed,</p>
<p>&ldquo;take the four of them to the foot of the jewel tower and give them a vegetarian meal. After the meal open up the pavilion, select a few rol s from each of the thirty-five scriptures in my Three Stores, and tel them to propagate these scriptures in the East, where they may eternal y grant their great goodness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acting on the orders of the Buddha the two arhats then led the four pilgrims to the bot om of the tower, where no end of rare and wonderful jewels and treasures were set out. Here the divinities who made offerings set out a vegetarian banquet, with immortal food, immortal delicacies, immortal tea, immortal fruit, and every kind of culinary delight not to be found in the mortal world. Master and disciples bowed their heads to the ground in thanks for the Buddha&rsquo;s kindness and proceeded to eat to their hearts&rsquo; content.</p>
<p>Indeed</p>
<p>Precious flames and golden light dazzled the eye, While the rare incense and delicacies were marvelously fine.</p>
<p>1555</p>
<p>The thousand-storied golden pavilion was infinitely lovely, And pure sounded immortals&rsquo; music on the ear.</p>
<p>Meatless food and magic flowers of the sort that are rare on earth, Fragrant teas and exotic dishes that give eternal life.</p>
<p>After a long period of enduring a thousand kinds of suffering, Today comes the glorious happiness of the Way completed.</p>
<p>This was a piece of good fortune for Pig, and a great, benefit to Friar Sand as they ate their fil of the food in the Buddha&rsquo;s land that gave eternal life and new flesh and bones for old. The two arhats kept the four of them company til the meal was over, after which they went to the treasure pavilion, where the doors were opened for them to go in and look. Over this al was a thousandfold aura of coloured light and auspicious vapors, while bril iant mists and clouds of good omen wafted al around. Al over the scripture shelves and on the outside of the cases were pasted red labels on which were neatly writ en the titles of the scriptures. They were the Nirvana sutra 748 rol s</p>

<p>Ananda and Kasyapa led the Tang Priest to read the titles of al the scriptures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come here from the East, holy monk,&rdquo; they said to him. &ldquo;Have you brought us any presents? Hand them over right now, then we can give you the scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Sanzang heard this he said, &ldquo;Your disciple Xuanzang has come a very long way, and I did not bring any with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very fine,&rdquo; the two arhats said with a laugh. &ldquo;If we hand the scriptures over for nothing, they&rsquo;l be passed down through the ages and our successors wil have to starve to death.&rdquo; Monkey could not stand hearing them talking tough like this and refusing to hand the scriptures over, so he shouted, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and report them to the Tathagata, Master. We&rsquo;l get him to give me the scriptures himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo; said Kasyapa. &ldquo;Where do you think you are, acting up like this?</p>
<p>Come here and take the scriptures.&rdquo; Pig and Friar Sand, who were keeping their own tempers under control, calmed Monkey down. They turned back to accept the scriptures, which were packed one by one into the luggage.</p>
<p>Some of it was put on the horse&rsquo;s back, and the rest tied up as two carrying-pole loads that Pig and Friar Sand shouldered. They al then returned to the Buddha&rsquo;s throne, kowtowed, thanked the Tathagata and went straight out.</p>
<p>They bowed twice to every Buddha and every Bodhisat va they met. When they reached the main entrance they bowed to the bhiksus, the bhiksunis, the laymen and the laywomen, taking their leave of each one. Then they hurried back down the mountain.</p>
<p>The story tel s not of them but of the Ancient Buddha Dipamkara, who had been quietly listening in the library when the scriptures were handed over. He 1557</p>
<p>understood perfectly wel that Ananda and Kasyapa had handed over wordless scriptures. &ldquo;Those stupid monks from the East didn&rsquo;t realize that those were wordless scriptures,&rdquo; he thought with a smile to himself. &ldquo;The holy monks journey across al those mountains and rivers wil be a complete waste. Who is in at endance here?&rdquo; he cal ed, and the arhat Suklavira stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Use your divine might,&rdquo; Dipamkara instructed him, &ldquo;and go after the Tang Priest like a shooting star. Take the wordless scriptures from him and tel him to come back to fetch the true scriptures.&rdquo; The arhat Suklavira then flew off on a storm wind that roared away from the Thunder Monastery as he gave a great display of his divine might. That splendid wind real y was A warrior from the Buddha&rsquo;s presence,</p>
<p>Greater than the two wind gods of the Xun quarter.</p>
<p>The angry roars from his divine orifices</p>
<p>Were more powerful by far than the puffs of a young girl.</p>
<p>This wind made</p>
<p>Fish and dragons lose their dens,</p>
<p>While the waves flowed backwards in rivers and seas.</p>
<p>Black apes could not present the fruit they carried; Yel ow cranes turned back to the clouds as they sought their nests.</p>
<p>Ugly rang the song of the red phoenix;</p>
<p>Raucous were the cal s of the multicolored pheasants.</p>
<p>The branches of hoary pines were broken</p>
<p>As the flowers of the udumbara blew away.</p>
<p>Every cane of green bamboo bowed low;</p>
<p>Al the blooms of golden lotus swayed.</p>
<p>The sound of the bel was carried a thousand miles While the chanting of sutras flew lightly up the ravines.</p>
<p>Ruined was the beauty of flowers under the crag; The tender shoots of plants were laid low by the path The bril iant phoenixes could hardly spread their wings; White deer hid beneath the cliffs.</p>
<p>The heavens were heavy with fragrance</p>
<p>As the clear wind blew right through the clouds.</p>
<p>The Tang Priest was walking along when he smelt the fragrant wind, but he paid no at ention to it, taking it for an auspicious sign of the Lord Buddha.</p>
<p>1558</p>
<p>Then a noise could be heard as a hand reached down from midair to lift the scriptures lightly off the horse&rsquo;s back, which gave Sanzang such a shock that he beat his chest and howled aloud. Pig scrambled along in pursuit, Friar Sand guarded the carrying-poles loaded with scriptures, and Brother Monkey flew after the arhat. Seeing that Monkey had almost caught up with him, and frightened that the merciless cudgel would make no bones about wounding him badly, the arhat tore the bundle of scriptures to shreds and flung it into the dust. When Monkey saw the bundle fal ing in pieces that were being scat ered by the fragrant wind he stopped chasing the arhat and brought his cloud down to look after the scriptures. The arhat Suklavira put the wind and the clouds away, then went back to report to Dipamkara.</p>
<p>When Pig, who was also in pursuit, saw the scriptures fal ing he helped Monkey to col ect them up and carry them back to the Tang Priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disciples,&rdquo; the Tang Priest exclaimed, tears pouring from his eyes, &ldquo;even in this world of bliss evil demons cheat people.&ldquo;After gathering up the scat ered scriptures in his arms Friar Sand opened one of them up and saw that it was as white as snow: not a word was writ en on it.</p>
<p>Quickly he handed it to Sanzang with the remark, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing in this scrol , Master.&rdquo; Monkey opened out another scrol to find that it had nothing writ en in it either. Pig opened another and it too had nothing in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open them al for us to examine,&rdquo; said Sanzang. Every single scrol was blank paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We Easterners real y do have no luck,&rdquo; he said, sighing and groaning. &ldquo;What point is there in fetching wordless scriptures like these? How could I ever face the Tang emperor? I wil have no way of avoiding execution for the crime of lying to my sovereign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey, who already understood what had happened, then said to the Tang Priest, &ldquo;Say no more, Master. Ananda and Kasyapa gave us these scrol s of blank paper because we hadn&rsquo;t got any presents to give them when they asked for them. Let&rsquo;s go back, report them to the Tathagata and get them accused of extortion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; shouted Pig, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right. Let&rsquo;s report them.&rdquo; The four of them then hurried up the mountain again, and after a few steps they were rushing back to the Thunder Monastery.</p>
<p>Before long they were once more outside the gates of the monastery, where everyone raised their clasped hands in greeting. &ldquo;Have you holy monks come 1559</p>
<p>to exchange your scriptures?&rdquo; they asked with smiles. Sanzang nodded and expressed his thanks. The vajrapanis did not block them, but let them go straight in to the Mahavira Hal .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tathagata,&rdquo; yel ed Monkey, &ldquo;our master and the rest of us have had to put up with endless monsters, demons, troubles and hardships to get here from the East to worship you. You gave the orders for the scriptures to be handed over, butAnanda and Kasyapa didn&rsquo;t do so because they were trying to extort things from us. They conspired and deliberately let us take away blank paper versions without a single word writ en on them. But what&rsquo;s the point in taking those? I beg you to have them punished, Tathagata.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop yel ing,&rdquo; replied the Lord Buddha with a smile. &ldquo;I already know that they asked you for presents. But the scriptures cannot be casual y passed on.</p>
<p>Nor can they be taken away for nothing. In the past bhiksus and holy monks went down the mountain and recited these scriptures to the family of the elder Zhao in the land of Sravasti. This ensured peace and safety for the living and deliverance for the dead members of the family. Al that was asked for was three bushels and three pecks of granular gold. I said they had sold the scriptures too cheap, so I saw to it that Zhao&rsquo;s sons and grandsons would be poor. You were given blank texts because you came here to fetch them empty-handed. The blank texts are true, wordless scriptures, and they real y are good. But as you living beings in the East are so deluded and have not achieved enlightenment we&rsquo;l have to give you these ones instead. Ananda, Kasyapa,&rdquo; he cal ed, &ldquo;fetch the true scriptures with words at once. Choose a few rol s from each title to give them, then come back here and tel me how many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two arhats then led the four pilgrims to the foot of the library building and once again asked the Tang Priest for a present. Having nothing else to offer, he ordered friar Sand to bring out the begging bowl of purple gold and presented it with both hands. &ldquo;Your disciple is poor and has come a very long way,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I did not bring any presents with me. This bowl was given to me by the Tang emperor with his own hands to beg for food with on my journey. I now offer it to you as a token of my heartfelt feelings. I beg you arhats not to despise it but to keep it. When I return to my court I shal report this to the Tang emperor, who wil certainly reward you richly. I only ask you to give me the true scriptures that have words to save me from failing in my imperial mission and making this long, hard journey for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1560</p>
<p>Ananda accepted the bowl with no more than a hint of a smile. The warriors guarding the precious library building, the kitchen staff responsible for the spices and the arhats in charge of the library rubbed each other&rsquo;s faces, pat ed each other&rsquo;s backs, flicked each other with their fingers and pul ed faces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disgraceful,&rdquo; they al said with grins, &ldquo;disgraceful. Demanding presents from the pilgrims who&rsquo;ve come to fetch the scriptures!&rdquo; A moment later Ananda was frowning with embarrassment but stil holding the bowl and not let ing go. Only then did Kasyapa go into the library to check the scriptures through one by one and give them to Sanzang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disciples,&rdquo; cal ed Sanzang, &ldquo;take a good look at them, not like last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three of them took the rol s and examined them one by one. Al had words. 5,048 rol s were handed over, the total in a single store. They were neatly packed up and put on the horse, and those left over were made into a carrying-pole load for Pig to take. Friar Sand carried their own luggage, and as Brother Monkey led the horse the Tang Priest took his staff, pushed his Vairocana mitre into position, shook his brocade cassock, and went happily into the presence of the Tathagata. Indeed:</p>
<p>Sweet taste the True Scriptures of the Great Store, Created fine and majestic by the Tathagata.</p>
<p>Remember what Xuanzang suffered to climb this mountain: Ananda&rsquo;s greed was something ridiculous.</p>
<p>What they did not notice at first Dipamkara helped them to see; Later the scriptures were real and they then found peace.</p>
<p>Successful now, they would take the scriptures to the East; Where al could be refreshed by their life-giving richness.</p>
<p>Ananda and Kasyapa led the Tang Priest to see the Tathagata, who ascended his lotus throne and directed the two great arhats Dragon-quel er and Tiger-subduer to strike the cloud-ringing stone chimes that summoned al the Three Thousand Buddhas, Three Thousand Protectors, Eight Vajrapanis, Four Bodhisat vas, Five Hundred Arhats, Eight Hundred Bhiksus, the host of laymen, bhiksunis, laywomen, and the greater and lesser honoured ones and holy monks of every cave, every heaven, the blessed lands and the magic mountains. Those who were supposed to sit were asked to ascend their precious thrones, and those who were supposed to stand stood on either side.</p>
<p>Al of a sudden heavenly music rang out from afar and magical sounds wafted around. The air was ful of countless beams of auspicious light and 1561</p>
<p>of aura upon aura as al the Buddhas gathered together to pay their respects to the Tathagata.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many rol s of scripture have you given them, Ananda and Kasyapa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>the Tathagata asked. &ldquo;Please tel me the numbers one by one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two arhats then reported, &ldquo;We are now handing over for the Tang court the</p>

<p>From the thirty-five scriptures in al of the stores we have selected 5,048 rol s to give to the holy monk. These wil be kept and handed down in Tang. They have now al been packed neatly and put on the horse or made into carrying-pole loads. The pilgrims are only waiting to express their thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanzang and his three fol owers then tethered the horse, put down the loads, joined their hands in front of their chests and bowed in worship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The achievement of these scriptures is immeasurable,&rdquo; the Tathagata said to the Tang Priest, &ldquo;Although they are the source of foreknowledge and reflection for my school they are truly the origin of al Three Schools. If they reach your Southern Continent of Jambudvipa they must not be treated with disrespect when they are shown to al living beings. Nobody who has not bathed, avoided eating meat and observed the prohibitions may open the rol s. Treasure them. Honour them. They include the esoteric mysteries of the way of immortality and wonderful methods for discovering al transformations.&rdquo; Kowtowing in thanks, Sanzang faith ful y accepted these instructions and determined to carry them out, did three more circuits of homage round the Lord Buddha then with dutiful and sincere obedience accepted the scriptures and went out with them through the third of the monastery gates, where he thanked al the holy beings one by one again. Of him we wil say no more.</p>
<p>After sending the Tang Priest on his way the Tathagata dissolved the assembly that had been cal ed to pass on the scriptures. The Bodhisat va Guanyin then stepped forward from the side, put her hands together and submit ed to the lord Buddha, &ldquo;It has been fourteen years from the time when your disciple went to the East that year to find the man who would fetch the scriptures to his success today. That makes 5,040 days. May the World-honoured One al ow the holy monks to go back East from the West within eight days, so as to complete the number of rol s in one store, and then your disciple may report his mission as completed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say is quite right,&rdquo; replied the Tathagata with delight. &ldquo;You are permit ed to report the completion of your mission.&rdquo; With that he instructed 1563</p>
<p>the Eight Vajrapanis, &ldquo;You are to use your divine might to escort the holy monks back to the East, where they wil hand the true scriptures over to be kept there.After escorting the holy monks back, you may return to the West.</p>
<p>This must be done within eight days in order to match the number of rol s in one store. There must be no disobedience or delay.&rdquo; The vajrapanis caught up with the Tang Priest. &ldquo;Come with us, scripture-fetchers,&rdquo; they cal ed; and the Tang Priest and the others became light and strong as they floated up on clouds after the vajrapanis. Indeed:</p>
<p>Nature revealed and mind made clear, they visited the Buddha; Actions complete and al achieved, they flew aloft.</p>
<p>If you do not know how they passed on the scriptures after returning to the East, listen to the explanation in the next instal ment.</p>
