<p><em>Admiring the Moon Festival Lanterns in Jinping</em> <em>The Tang Priest Confesses in Dark Essence Cave</em> Where should one strive to practice dhyana?</p>
<p>Swiftly to extirpate the misdeeds of the thought-horse and the mind-ape.</p>
<p>When they are firmly tethered they give off radiance, But whoever halts fal s to the three paths of suffering.</p>
<p>If one al ows the divine elixir to leak away, The jade-pure nature wil wither as one slackens.</p>
<p>Anger, joy and worry must al be swept away:</p>
<p>When the wonderful mystery is gained it seems like nothing.</p>
<p>The story tel s how the Tang Priest and his three disciples left the city of Yuhua and had a very easy journey in what real y was a land of paradise.</p>
<p>When they had been travel ing for five or six days another city appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is this?&rdquo; the Tang Priest asked Brother Monkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a city,&rdquo; Monkey replied, &ldquo;but there are no flags on the poles above the city wal and I don&rsquo;t know this area, so I&rsquo;l ask when we get closer.&rdquo; When they reached the Eastern suburb they found it noisy with bars and tea-houses and bustling with a rice market and oil shops. Some idlers who were wandering in the streets with nothing bet er to do crowded round for a bet er look when they saw Pig&rsquo;s long snout, Friar Sand&rsquo;s black face and Monkey&rsquo;s red eyes, but they dared not come any closer to question the travelers. The Tang Priest was sweating with the worry that they would provoke trouble as they crossed several more streets and had stil not yet reached the city wal .</p>
<p>Then they saw a monastery gate over which were the words CLOUDS OF</p>
<p>COMPASSION MONASTERY.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about going in here to give the horse a rest and take a meal?&rdquo; the Tang Priest suggested, to which Monkey replied, &ldquo;Splendid, splendid.&rdquo; The four of them then went inside, and this is what they saw: Splendid, towering buildings,</p>
<p>Gleaming bases for statues.</p>
<p>The Buddha hal rise above the clouds;</p>
<p>The monks&rsquo; cel s lie in the moonlit silence.</p>
<p>1435</p>
<p>Red mists circle the stupas;</p>
<p>In the shade of jade-green trees the scripture-wheel is cool.</p>
<p>This is a true Pure Land,</p>
<p>Another Naga Palace,</p>
<p>Where purple mists surround the Mahavira Hal .</p>
<p>The cloisters are never empty of people enjoying the sights, And visitors climb the pagoda that is always open.</p>
<p>Incense burns in the stand at every moment,</p>
<p>And lamps shine on the altar through the night.</p>
<p>A golden bel rings rhythmical y in the abbot&rsquo;s lodgings As monks worship the Buddha by reciting sutras.</p>
<p>As the four of them looked around a monk came along the cloister and said to the Tang Priest with polite gestures of greeting, &ldquo;Where have you come from, Teacher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the Tang Court in China,&rdquo; the Tang Priest replied, at which the monk went down on his knees to kowtow, only to be quickly helped up by the Tang Priest, who asked, &ldquo;Why do you perform this great courtesy, reverend abbot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Al the lovers of goodness here who read the sutras and recite the name of the Buddha hope to achieve rebirth in your land of China, so that when I saw you coming in your magnificent mitre and robes I was certain that your present splendor must be the result of your successful cultivation in earlier lives. That&rsquo;s why it is right to kowtow to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It alarmed me,&rdquo; said the Tang Priest with a smile, &ldquo;it alarmed me. I am only an itinerant monk, and know no splendor at al . To be able to live at your leisure and ease as you do, abbot, is real bliss.&rdquo; The monk then led the Tang Priest to worship the Buddha statues in the main hal . It was only now that Sanzang cal ed for his disciples. After seeing their master start talking to the monk, Monkey and the other two had been standing in a group with their faces averted, holding the horse&rsquo;s bridle and looking after the luggage, so that the monk had not noticed them.</p>
<p>But when they turned round on hearing the Tang Priest&rsquo;s cal the sight of them so frightened the monk that he cal ed out, &ldquo;My lord, why are your distinguished disciples so hideously ugly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugly they may be,&rdquo; the Tang Priest replied, &ldquo;but they do have some magical powers. I have been very grateful for their protection al the way along the 1436</p>
<p>journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were speaking more monks came out to greet them. The monk who had been the first to welcome the visitors explained to the others, &ldquo;This teacher has come from Great Tang in China, and these three gentlemen are his distinguished disciples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; said the others with mixed pleasure and apprehension, &ldquo;why have you come here from Great China?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been commanded by the Tang emperor to worship the Buddha and seek the scriptures in the Western Heaven,&rdquo; Sanzang replied. &ldquo;As I was passing this way I have come to your monastery to ask where we are and take a vegetarian meal before set ing out again.&rdquo; The monks were al delighted, and they invited the visitors into the abbot&rsquo;s lodgings, where there were some more monks who were performing ceremonies on behalf of benefactors.</p>
<p>The monk who had met them first went on to explain to the others, &ldquo;Come and have a look at what people from China are like: some are handsome and some are ugly. The beauty of the handsome ones could never be caught in a painting or drawing, and the ugly ones look real y weird.&rdquo; Both the monks and the benefactors al came to greet them, after which everyone sat down.</p>
<p>When tea had been drunk the Tang Priest inquired, &ldquo;What is this fine country cal ed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Jinping, one of the outer prefectures of India,&rdquo; the monks replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is it from this prefecture to Vulture Peak?&rdquo; the Tang Priest asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is about seven hundred miles from here to the capital,&rdquo; the monks replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;and we have walked that distance. As we haven&rsquo;t gone further West to Vulture Peak we don&rsquo;t know how far that is and would not like to make a wild guess.&rdquo; The Tang Priest thanked them.</p>
<p>A lit le later a vegetarian meal was provided, after which the Tang Priest wanted to be on his way, only to be pressed to stay by the monks and the benefactors who said, &ldquo;Teacher, you must stay for a couple of days or so.</p>
<p>Enjoy the Ful Moon Festival before you go on your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my journey I have only been aware of mountains and rivers and the danger of running into ogres or monsters,&rdquo; the Tang Priest replied, &ldquo;and I have lost my sense of time. I don&rsquo;t know when Ful Moon is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s because your heart is so set on worshipping the Buddha and on enlightenment that you have not thought about it, Teacher,&rdquo; the monks 1437</p>
<p>replied. &ldquo;Today is the thirteenth of the first month and the lanterns wil be tried out tonight. The day after tomorrow is the fifteenth, when the festival begins, and it goes on til the lanterns are put away on the eighteenth or nineteenth. We enjoy celebrations here and our prefect, who cares for the people, has lanterns set out everywhere and music played al night. We also have a Bridge of Golden Lamps&mdash;it&rsquo;s an ancient tradition that stil flourishes.</p>
<p>If you wil stay for a few days, my lords, our monastery can certainly afford to entertain you.&rdquo; The Tang Priest had no choice but to stay. As the bel and drum in the Buddha hal resounded to the skies the faithful came in from the streets bringing lanterns to present to the Buddha. The Tang Priest and the rest of them came out of the abbot&rsquo;s lodgings to look at the lanterns, after which everyone turned in.</p>
<p>The next day, when they had eaten the vegetarian breakfast the monks of the monastery brought them, they strol ed in the garden at the back. It real y was a lovely place:</p>
<p>It is the first month of the year,</p>
<p>The beginning of the spring.</p>
<p>The wooded garden is quiet and elegant;</p>
<p>The beauty of the scene subdued.</p>
<p>Throughout the four seasons flowers and trees contend; Turquoise peaks rise behind each other.</p>
<p>Fragrant flowers are growing before the steps, And scent comes from the plum-tree&rsquo;s branches.</p>
<p>Where there is red it joins the tender peach blossom; Where there is green it mingles with the wil ows&rsquo; fresh green.</p>
<p>Forget about the splendor of the Gold Val ey Garden; Say nothing of the Wang River landscapes painted by Wang Wei.</p>
<p>In the flowing stream</p>
<p>The wild ducks bob and rise;</p>
<p>Among bamboos by the thousand</p>
<p>Poets ponder their choice of words.</p>
<p>Tree and herbaceous peonies, myrtle, fleeting-smile flowers, That waken when their time is due;</p>
<p>Camel ias, red plum blossom, winter jasmine and daphne, Al early to open out their beauty.</p>
<p>The snow piled by the hidden cliff seems frozen solid stil ; 1438</p>
<p>The clouds that drift by the distant trees already bring early traces of spring.</p>
<p>The deer sees its reflection beside the pool; Cranes come to hear the lute beneath the pines.</p>
<p>A few hal s and pavilions to East and West,</p>
<p>Where travelers may stay;</p>
<p>Buildings and pagodas to North and South</p>
<p>Where monks may meditate in peace.</p>
<p>Among the flowers</p>
<p>Are one or two houses to nourish one&rsquo;s nature, Where double eaves rise above each other.</p>
<p>Amid the hil s and streams</p>
<p>Are three or four cel s in which to reline magic, Peaceful and light.</p>
<p>This is indeed a natural spot for a recluse:</p>
<p>Why look elsewhere for the earthly paradise?</p>
<p>After a day enjoying the garden they inspected the lanterns in the Buddha hal before going to look at the lantern festival. This is what they saw: A splendid city of agate,</p>
<p>A fairyland of glass;</p>
<p>Palaces of crystal and mica,</p>
<p>Like layer upon layer of brocade,</p>
<p>Openwork carving behind openwork carving.</p>
<p>The dazzling bridge of stars moved heaven and earth While trees of fire made waves of red</p>
<p>Flutes and drums played in the streets.</p>
<p>A moon like a ring of jade hung over a thousand gates; Fragrant breezes blew through ten thousand homes.</p>
<p>There were giant turtle peaks soaring on high, Fishes and dragons emerging from the sea,</p>
<p>Phoenixes sporting in the sky.</p>
<p>As al admired the moon and the lanterns</p>
<p>The atmosphere was ful of harmony.</p>
<p>Among the crowds dressed in fine silks</p>
<p>Al enjoyed the songs and panpipes.</p>
<p>Carriages rumbled along.</p>
<p>There was no end of beautiful faces,</p>
<p>Dashing gal ants, And marvel ous sights.</p>
<p>1439</p>
<p>When Sanzang and the others had looked at the lanterns in the monastery they wandered around the streets of the Eastern suburb, not going back to bed til the second watch in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>The next day Sanzang said to the monks, &ldquo;I made a vow to sweep pagodas, and on the occasion of tonight&rsquo;s Moon Festival I would like to ask the reverend abbot to open the doors of the pagoda to al ow me to fulfil this vow.&rdquo; The monks opened the doors, and when Friar Sand fetched his cassock and brought it to him on the ground floor he put it over his shoulders and prayed to the Buddha. Then he swept the ground floor with a broom, took the cassock off and gave it back to Friar Sand. He swept the second story next, and so on story by story til he reached the top. In every story there was a Buddha, and in each one he opened al the windows, swept the floor, and enjoyed the splendid views. By the time he had finished sweeping and come down again it was late and al the lamps had been lit.</p>
<p>It was now the night of the ful moon. &ldquo;Venerable teacher,&rdquo; the monks said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;last night you only saw the lamps in our humble monastery and the outskirts of the city.As tonight is the main festival why don&rsquo;t we go into the city to see the golden lamps there?&rdquo; The Tang Priest was glad to fol ow this suggestion, and he went with his three disciples and the monks of the monastery into the city to see the lanterns. Indeed:</p>
<p>On the festive fifteenth night</p>
<p>The harmony of spring begins with the first ful moon.</p>
<p>Decorated lanterns hang in the busy markets</p>
<p>As al sing the songs of a world at peace.</p>
<p>Over the lantern light in streets and markets The moon&rsquo;s round mirror rises in the sky</p>
<p>Like a silver dish, driven by the charioteer Ping Yi.</p>
<p>The lanterns were like a brocade carpet woven by fairies; The lanterns were reflected by the moon,</p>
<p>Doubling its bril iance;</p>
<p>The moon shone on the lanterns,</p>
<p>Making them resplendent.</p>
<p>There was no end of iron-chain star bridges,</p>
<p>Lantern flowers and trees of fire.</p>
<p>Snowflake lanterns,</p>
<p>Plum-blossom lanterns,</p>
<p>1440</p>
<p>Like fragments of ice in spring;</p>
<p>Embroidered screen lanterns,</p>
<p>Painted screen lanterns,</p>
<p>Made up from every color.</p>
<p>Walnut lanterns,</p>
<p>Lotus lanterns,</p>
<p>Hung high on lantern towers;</p>
<p>Blue lion lanterns,</p>
<p>White elephant lanterns,</p>
<p>Fixed on lofty frames.</p>
<p>Shrimp lanterns,</p>
<p>Terrapin lanterns,</p>
<p>Placed in front of awnings;</p>
<p>Goat lanterns,</p>
<p>Hare lanterns,</p>
<p>Bringing the eaves to life.</p>
<p>Eagle lanterns,</p>
<p>Phoenix lanterns,</p>
<p>Lined up next to each other;</p>
<p>Tiger lanterns,</p>
<p>Horse lanterns,</p>
<p>Being carried along together.</p>
<p>Red-crowned crane lanterns,</p>
<p>White deer lanterns,</p>
<p>Carrying the Star of Longevity;</p>
<p>Goldfish lanterns,</p>
<p>Whale lanterns,</p>
<p>On which rode the poet Li Bai.</p>
<p>Giant turtle mountain lanterns,</p>
<p>Where gods and immortals gathered;</p>
<p>Revolving horse lanterns</p>
<p>On which warriors joined combat.</p>
<p>The towers of lanterns on thousands of houses Made a world of clouds and smoke for several miles.</p>
<p>On one side, shining reins and flying jade saddles; On the other, rumbling carriages leave fragrance behind.</p>
<p>1441</p>
<p>On the red balcony,</p>
<p>Leaning against the railings,</p>
<p>Behind the curtains,</p>
<p>Shoulder to shoulder,</p>
<p>Hand in hand,</p>
<p>Pairs of beauties were eager for the fun.</p>
<p>By the bridge over green waters,</p>
<p>Noisy,</p>
<p>Many-coloured,</p>
<p>Drunken,</p>
<p>Laughing</p>
<p>Couples enjoyed the bril iant sights.</p>
<p>Al of the city&rsquo;s flutes and drums were playing; Panpipes and songs went on al night.</p>
<p>There is also this poem as evidence:</p>
<p>Amid the fine brocades, of lotus were the songs; This blessed land at peace was ful of many throngs.</p>
<p>The lanterns and the moon upon this festive night Foretold rich harvests after rain and wind just right.</p>
<p>This was a night when the curfew was relaxed, so that there were huge crowds and a great commotion. People were dancing, walking on stilts, wearing masks and riding elephants, pushing and crowding to East and to West as they looked al around. When they reached the bridge of golden lamps the Tang Priest and the monks pushed forward for a look and saw that it consisted of three golden lamps each the size of a water vat and shaped like a two-storied pavilion with a light shining out through intricate gold and silver filigree openwork. Glazed ceramic tiles inside the lamps reflected their light. They were so bright they outshone the moon, and their oil was very fragrant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of oil do those lamps burn?&rdquo; the Tang Priest asked the monks,</p>
<p>&ldquo;and why does it smel so remarkably good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t know that, Teacher,&rdquo; the monks replied. &ldquo;There is a county near this prefecture cal ed Mintian. In the whole county there are 240 wards, and when we have our annual assignment of jobs to be done for the state, 240</p>
<p>households have to provide oil. Al the other jobs assigned by the prefecture or county are reasonable enough, but these oil households have a very hard 1442</p>
<p>time. Every household has to take it on for a year, and it costs them over two hundred ounces of silver. The oil isn&rsquo;t ordinary oil but perfumed refined but er oil. One ounce costs two ounces of silver and a pound costs thirty-two ounces. Each of the lamps holds five hundred pounds of oil, making 1,500</p>
<p>pounds for the three of them, costing 48,000 ounces of silver. With other miscel aneous expenses it comes to over 50,000 ounces. And that only lasts three nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can so much oil be used up in only three nights?&rdquo; Monkey asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In each lamp there are forty-nine big wicks about the size of an egg made of rushes wrapped in silk floss,&rdquo; the monks explained. &ldquo;When they have burned for one night the Lord Buddhas appear, the oil al vanishes and the lamp goes out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose the Lord Buddhas take al the oil,&rdquo; said Pig with a grin as he stood at one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; the monks replied, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what everyone in the city has always said ever since ancient times. If the oil runs dry they say that the Buddhas have taken the oil and the crops wil certainly be bountiful; but if it doesn&rsquo;t dry up on one occasion there wil be famine, drought and the wrong weather at the wrong time in that year. That&rsquo;s why everyone makes this offering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were talking there was the howling of a wind up in the air, sending everyone who was admiring the lanterns fleeing in terror. The monks could not hold their ground either. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go back, venerable teacher,&rdquo; they said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;the wind&rsquo;s here. It&rsquo;s the Lord Buddhas bringing blessings. They&rsquo;re here to see the lanterns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tel that?&rdquo; the Tang Priest asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same every year,&rdquo; the monks replied. &ldquo;The wind blows up before the third watch. Everybody gets out of the way as they know that it is the Lord Buddhas bringing down blessings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am one who thinks of, invokes and worships Buddhas,&rdquo; the Tang Priest said. &ldquo;If the Buddhas are honoring us with their presence on this festive occasion it would be wonderful to be able to worship them.&rdquo; He rejected the monks&rsquo; repeated urgings to go back, and a lit le later the forms of three Buddhas appeared in the wind and approached the lamps. The Tang Priest was so excited that he ran to the top of the lamp bridge and threw himself down worship.</p>
<p>Brother Monkey rushed forward in alarm to drag him to his feet and say, 1443</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re no good, Master. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;re evil.&rdquo; Before the words were even out of his mouth the lamps al went out as with a great whoosh the Tang Priest was swept up by the wind. It was terrible! Who knew what evil monsters from what cave in what mountain had been posing as Buddhas to watch the golden lamps?</p>
<p>Pig and Friar Sand were thrown into such panic that they rushed al about, searching and cal ing for their master. &ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; cal ed Monkey, &ldquo;no use shouting here. The master&rsquo;s bliss has turned to disaster. He&rsquo;s been carried off by evil spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you tel that, my lord,&rdquo; the appal ed monks asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just a bunch of mortals,&rdquo; Monkey replied with a grin, &ldquo;so you haven&rsquo;t realized what&rsquo;s been happening al these years. The evil spirits have fooled you into thinking they&rsquo;re true Buddhas coming down to accept the offerings of lamps. The Buddhas that appeared when the wind blew just now were three evil spirits. My master didn&rsquo;t realize who they were, so he went up on the top of the bridge to worship them. They covered up al the lights and carried him off together with the oil in the lamps. As I was a bit too late the three of them got away by wind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; said Friar Sand, &ldquo;Whatever are we to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a moment to lose,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;You two go back the monastery with the monks and look after the horse and the luggage. I&rsquo;m going after them while this wind&rsquo;s stil blowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The splendid Great Sage then shot up by his somersault cloud into mid air, picked up the stench of the wind and headed Northeast in pursuit, carrying on til al of a sudden the wind dropped at dawn. A great mountain could be seen, a most steep, towering and splendid mountain: Many a foothil and ravine,</p>
<p>Twisting and bending streams.</p>
<p>Creepers hang from the beetling precipice,</p>
<p>Pine and cypress rise from the lonely rock.</p>
<p>Cranes cry in the morning mists,</p>
<p>Wild geese cal among the clouds at dawn.</p>
<p>Jut ing peaks like a row of halberds,</p>
<p>Jagged crags of interlocking rocks.</p>
<p>The summits rise to eighty thousand feet,</p>
<p>And sheer-wal ed ridges make a thousand angles.</p>
<p>1444</p>
<p>Wild flowers and noble trees al flourish with the spring; Cuckoo and oriole respond to the scenery with song.</p>
<p>Majestic beauty,</p>
<p>Towering grandeur,</p>
<p>Steep, grotesque crags hard to climb.</p>
<p>One wil stay there long in silence:</p>
<p>Al that can be heard are tigers and leopards breathing.</p>
<p>River deer and white deer wander around;</p>
<p>Jade-coloured hares and gray wolves come and go.</p>
<p>The stream in the deep ravine wil flow for a mil ion miles; Twisting torrents splash loud against the rocks.</p>
<p>While the Great Sage was on the top of a scar looking for his way he saw four people coming from the Western slopes driving three goats and al shouting,</p>
<p>&ldquo;New Year.&rdquo; Monkey&rsquo;s fiery eyes with their golden pupils flashed as he took a closer look to see that they were the four Duty Gods of the year, the month, the day and the hour in disguise.</p>
<p>The Great Sage then pul ed out his iron cudgel, shook it til it was as thick as a ricebowl and about twelve feet long and sprang down from the cliff with a shout of, &ldquo;Where are you skulking off to like that, trying to hide your faces?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the four Duty Gods realized that he had rumbled them they at once turned back into their normal selves, kowtowed beside the path and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive us, Great Sage, forgive us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because I haven&rsquo;t had any jobs for you recently you thought I was get ing lax and so you&rsquo;ve al become very casual,&rdquo; Monkey said. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t even greet me. It&rsquo;s outrageous! Why aren&rsquo;t you giving my master your secret protection? Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because your master somewhat forgot his dhyana nature and was so eager to enjoy himself in the Clouds of Compassion Monastery in Jinping Prefecture,&rdquo; the Duty Gods said, &ldquo;he met with evil at the height of splendor, his joy turned to disaster, and he was captured by the evil spirits. The Defenders of the Faith are looking after him at the moment. We realized that you would be coming after him this very night, Great Sage, and we came here to report to you in case you did not know the mountains and forests here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were here to report,&rdquo; said Brother Monkey, &ldquo;why did you disguise 1445</p>
<p>your identities, why were you driving three goats, and what were you shouting and yel ing for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three goats were for luck at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>They are to drive away the evil that&rsquo;s obstructing your master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey had been absolutely determined to beat them, but on hearing this explanation he let them off and put his cudgel away as his fury turned to delight. &ldquo;Are there evil spirits on this mountain?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; they replied, &ldquo;yes. This mountain is cal ed Green Dragon Mountain and there&rsquo;s a cave in it cal ed the Dark Essence Cave where three evil spirits live. The oldest is cal ed King Cold-avoider, the second is cal ed King Heat-avoider and the third is cal ed King Dust-avoider. They&rsquo;ve lived here for a thousand years and have been fond of refined but er oil since they were children. Ever since they became spirits some years ago they&rsquo;ve been pretending to be Buddhas to trick the officials and people of Jinping into set ing out those golden lamps ful of the refined but er oil that they take in their Buddha guises in the middle of every first month. When they saw your master this time they realized that he was a holy monk and carried him off to the cave too. Any day now they&rsquo;l slice off his flesh to fry in the refined but er. You must use your skil s to save him as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this Monkey dismissed the four Duty Gods with a shout and went round the mountain looking for the cave. Within a mile or two he saw a rock face by a gil , at the foot of which was a stone building with a pair of stone doors that stood ajar. Beside the doors was a stone tablet on which was inscribed</p>
<p>GREEN DRAGON MOUNTAIN</p>
<p>DARK ESSENCE CAVE</p>
<p>Not daring to go in uninvited, Monkey stopped and cal ed, &ldquo;Give me my master back at once, monster.&rdquo; With a great noise the doors burst wide open, and out rushed a crowd of bul -headed demons who glared as they asked,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, yel ing here like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the senior disciple of the holy monk Tang Sanzang who&rsquo;s come from Great Tang in the East to fetch scriptures,&rdquo; Monkey replied. &ldquo;He was looking at the lanterns in Jinping along our way when your chief demons carried him off here. Give him back at once if you want me to spare your lives. If you don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;l turn our den upside-down and turn al you demons into just pus and blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1446</p>
<p>As soon as the junior demons heard this they rushed inside to report,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Disaster, Your Majesties, disaster!&rdquo; The three old evil spirits had taken Sanzang into the depths of the cave and with no further ado were tel ing their underlings to strip him and wash him with water from the torrent. They were just about to have him sliced and diced into tiny pieces to fry in the refined but er when they heard the report of disaster from outside. The oldest demon king asked with some alarm what had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a hairy-faced monk who looks like a thunder god outside,&rdquo; the junior devils replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s shouting that Your Majesties carried his master here and wants him given back straight away if our lives are to be spared.</p>
<p>Otherwise he&rsquo;l turn our den upside-down and turn us al into pus and blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This news shocked the demon kings, who al said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve only just caught the wretch, and haven&rsquo;t even asked him his name and his background. Lit le ones, dress him again and bring him here to be questioned. We must find out who he is and where he&rsquo;s from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acrowd of devils untied the Tang Priest, put his clothes back on and pushed him to before the thrones, where he fel to his knees, trembling with fear, and pleaded, &ldquo;Spare my life, Your Majesties, spare my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you from, monk?&rdquo; the three evil spirits said, al talking at once,</p>
<p>&ldquo;and why did you rush into the way of our clouds instead of avoiding the Buddha images?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been sent by the Great Tang Emperor in the East to worship the Lord Buddha and fetch the scriptures from the Great Thunder Monastery in India,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanzang replied with kowtows. &ldquo;When I went into the Clouds of Compassion Monastery for a vegetarian meal the monks there pressed me to stay to see the lanterns at the Moon Festival. Seeing Your Majesties appearing as Buddhas from the bridge of golden lamps I kowtowed to you because my mortal eyes took you for real Buddhas. That&rsquo;s why I got in the way of your clouds, Your Majesties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long was the journey from your country in the East to here?&rdquo; the evil spirits asked. &ldquo;How many people have you got with you? What are they cal ed? Tel us the truth straight away and we&rsquo;l spare your life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My secular name was Chen Xuanzang,&rdquo; the Tang Priest replied, &ldquo;and I was a monk in the Jinshan Monastery from boyhood. Later I was given official rank as a monk in the Hongfu Monastery in Chang&rsquo;an. When the minister Wei Zheng beheaded the Dragon King of the River Jing in his dream and 1447</p>
<p>the Tang emperor came back to life after his travels in the underworld, a Great Land and Water Mass was held for the rebirth of souls. The Tang emperor chose me to officiate at this ceremony and expound the great principles. The Bodhisat va Guanyin appeared during the mass and informed me that in the Thunder Monastery in the Western Heaven there are three stores of true scriptures that can carry the dead up to Heaven. I was sent to fetch them and given the title Sanzang, or &ldquo;Three Stores.&rdquo; As I use Tang as my surname people cal me Tang Sanzang. I have three disciples. The first one is cal ed Sun Wukong the Novice, and he is the Great Sage Equaling Heaven who has been converted to the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This news came as a shock to the evil spirits, who asked, &ldquo;Did this Great Sage Equaling Heaven make great havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; the Tang Priest said. &ldquo;The second one is cal ed Zhu Wuneng or Zhu Bajie. He is Marshal Tian Peng come down to earth. The third is Sha Wujing, or Friar Sand, the Curtain-lifting General in mortal reincarnation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as wel we haven&rsquo;t eaten him yet,&rdquo; the evil spirits al exclaimed in horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lit le ones, lock the Tang Priest in iron chains at the back. When we&rsquo;ve caught his three disciples we&rsquo;l eat them together.&rdquo; They then mustered a force of armed yak, water-buf alo and ox spirits to go outside carrying bugles, waving banners and beating drums.</p>
<p>Once the three evil spirits were ful y clad in their armor they went out and shouted, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that who dares come here shouting like that?&rdquo; Monkey slipped round behind the scar to have a good look, and this is what the evil spirits were like:</p>
<p>Multi-coloured faces, round eyes,</p>
<p>Towering horns.</p>
<p>Four sharp-pointed ears,</p>
<p>Neat and shining bright.</p>
<p>Bodies pat erned like a painting,</p>
<p>Covered with brocades that shine like fireflies.</p>
<p>The first one wore a hat of foxes&rsquo; fur</p>
<p>And hot steam rose from the long hairs of his face.</p>
<p>The second wore a flaming cloak of lightest gauze And had four gleaming, jade-like hooves.</p>
<p>The third had a mighty roar like thunder;</p>
<p>His sharp and pointed fangs were just like silver needles.</p>
<p>1448</p>
<p>Each was brave and fierce</p>
<p>As they carried their three weapons;</p>
<p>One used a bat le-axe,</p>
<p>One was an expert in the cutlass,</p>
<p>And the third had a knot ed flail resting on his shoulders.</p>
<p>The other evil spirits, tal and short, fat and thin, senior and junior, were al cat le-headed monsters carrying spears or clubs. There were three big banners clearly inscribed with the words &ldquo;King Cold-avoider,&rdquo; &ldquo;King Heat-avoider&rdquo;</p>
<p>and &ldquo;King Dust-avoider.&ldquo;After looking at al this for a while Monkey lost his patience and went up to them with a shout of, &ldquo;Can you recognize Monkey, thieving damned ogres?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the Sun Wukong who made havoc in Heaven?&rdquo; the evil spirits shouted back. &ldquo;It real y is a case of</p>
<p>I heard your name before I saw your face:</p>
<p>The sight of that would bring the gods disgrace.</p>
<p>So al you are is a macaque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;l get you, you lamp-oil thieves,&rdquo; Monkey retorted in high dudgeon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk such rubbish, you smooth-tongued monsters. Give my master back at once.&rdquo; With that he advanced and swung his iron cudgel, to be parried by the old demons who raised their weapons to meet the blow. A splendid fight ensued in the mountain hol ow:</p>
<p>Bat le-axe, cutlass and flail</p>
<p>Met by the Monkey King&rsquo;s lone cudgel.</p>
<p>Cold-avoider, Heat-avoider and Dust-avoider</p>
<p>Had heard of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.</p>
<p>When the cudgel rose it scared demons and gods; Axe and cutlass hacked and flew.</p>
<p>A primal dharma image of true emptiness</p>
<p>Holding off three demons masquerading as Buddhas.</p>
<p>Their noses al greasy with this year&rsquo;s stolen oil, They tried to snatch the monk sent by the emperor.</p>
<p>One for his master&rsquo;s sake feared not the lengthy road; The others in their greed had lamps offered every year.</p>
<p>Al that could be beard was clash of axe and cutlass And the noisy clat er of the cudgel.</p>
<p>With clashes and lunges three fought against one 1449</p>
<p>As each showed his skil with blocks and parries.</p>
<p>They fought from dawn til almost nightfal</p>
<p>And a victor had yet to emerge in the struggle.</p>
<p>By the time Monkey&rsquo;s cudgel had gone 150 rounds with the three demons it was nearly evening and the outcome was stil in doubt. Then Dust-avoider sprang forward from the ranks with a swing of his flail and waved a flag, whereupon the crowd of cat le-headed demons swarmed round Monkey, encircling him and swinging wildly at him with their weapons. Seeing that things were going badly, Monkey set off his somersault cloud and fled in a whoosh. The demons did not go after him but cal ed their devils back so that everyone could have an evening meal. They told the junior devils to take a bowl of food to Sanzang as wel : he was not to be dealt with until Monkey had been caught. As the master was a lifelong vegetarian and was besides feeling miserable he sobbed and let none of the food touch his lips.</p>
<p>The story tel s how Monkey rode his cloud back to the Clouds of Compassion Monastery and cal ed, &ldquo;Brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On hearing this Pig and Friar Sand, who were waiting for him and discussing what to do, came out together to greet him with the words, &ldquo;Brother, why are you only back now after being away al day? What&rsquo;s happened to the master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fol owed the smel of the wind right through the night til we got to a mountain and it disappeared,&rdquo; Monkey replied with a smile. &ldquo;Luckily the four Duty Gods told me that the mountain&rsquo;s cal ed Green Dragon Mountain and that there&rsquo;s a Dark Essence Cave on it where three evil spirits live: King Cold-avoider, King Heat-avoider and King Dust-avoider. They&rsquo;ve been stealing the oil here for years on end by disguising themselves as Buddhas to trick the officials of Jinping Prefecture. When they came across us this year they wickedly carried our master off with them. I told the Duty Gods and the rest of them to give the master some secret protection while I shouted insults at them from outside their doors. When the three demons came out they al looked like bul headed demons. The first of them fought with a bat le-axe, the second with a cutlass and the third with a flail. They had a whole gang of cat le-headed monsters with them, waving banners and beating drums. The fight went on al day and was stil in the balance when one of the demon kings waved a flag to bring al the junior devils forward.</p>
<p>As it was late and I was worried that I couldn&rsquo;t beat them I came back by 1450</p>
<p>somersault cloud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon it must be the Demon King of Fengdu who&rsquo;s making trouble for you,&rdquo; said Pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you guess that?&rdquo; Friar Sand asked. &ldquo;I can tel because our big brother said they were al cat le-headed monsters,&rdquo; replied Pig with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;I saw them and they were al rhinoceros spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re rhinos we&rsquo;ve just got to catch them and saw their horns off,&rdquo; said Pig. &ldquo;They&rsquo;l be worth quite a bit of silver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were talking the monks al asked Monkey if he had eaten any supper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;l have something if it&rsquo;s no trouble,&rdquo; Brother Monkey replied, &ldquo;but I can do without just as wel .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you&rsquo;re hungry after fighting al day, my lord,&rdquo; the monks said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t get hungry in a mere day,&rdquo; Monkey laughed. &ldquo;I once went without food for five hundred years.&rdquo; The monks did not know whether he was tel ing the truth or joking, and a lit le later food was brought in that Monkey ate, after which he said, &ldquo;Tidy up and go to sleep. We&rsquo;l go and fight them again tomorrow and capture the demon kings so as to rescue the master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What nonsense, brother,&rdquo; said Friar Sand, who was standing to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the saying goes, &lsquo;Delay brings wisdom.&rsquo; It&rsquo;l be terrible if that monster stays awake tonight and murders the master. We&rsquo;d bet er go there right now and make such a row that he can&rsquo;t do anything. It may go badly wrong if we lose a single moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Pig heard this he braced himself and said, &ldquo;Friar Sand&rsquo;s right. Let&rsquo;s go and put down those demons. The moon&rsquo;s bright enough.&rdquo; Accepting their advice, Monkey left his instructions with the monks of the monastery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look after the luggage and the horse. When we&rsquo;ve captured the evil spirits we&rsquo;l bring them back here to prove to the prefect that they&rsquo;re imposters.</p>
<p>Then he can end the oil levy and relieve the common people of this hardship.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;l be a good thing, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; The monks al accepted their orders while the three of them left the city by auspicious cloud. Indeed: Idleness and unrestraint</p>
<p>Threw the dhyana into confusion;</p>
<p>Danger and catastrophe</p>
<p>Led the Way-heart into delusion.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know who was to win this encounter listen to the explanation in the next instal ment.</p>
