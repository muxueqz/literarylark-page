<p><em>Two Minds Throw Heaven and Earth into Uproar</em> <em>One Body Cannot Achieve True Nirvana</em></p>
<p>When Monkey and Friar Sand took their leave of the Bodhisat va they departed from the Southern Ocean by two beams of auspicious light. Now Monkey&rsquo;s somersault cloud was much faster than Friar Sand&rsquo;s immortal&rsquo;s cloud, so Monkey was drawing ahead when Friar Sand pul ed him back and said, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for you to show me your heels like that, brother, rushing ahead to sort things out at home. Wait for me to come with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Brother Monkey&rsquo;s intentions were good Friar Sand could not help being suspicious. The two of them then flew their clouds together and were soon in sight of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. They brought their clouds down and had a good look at the outside of the cave, where there was indeed a Monkey sit ing on a high stone terrace, drinking and making merry with his monkey hosts. He looked exactly the same as the Great Sage: yel ow hair held in a golden band, fiery eyes with golden pupils, a brocade tunic, a tigerskin kilt, a gold-banded iron cudgel in his hands, and deerskin boots.</p>
<p>He had the same</p>
<p>Hairy face like a thunder god,</p>
<p>Cheeks like the planet Saturn;</p>
<p>Pointed ears and a forehead broad,</p>
<p>And long, protruding fangs.</p>
<p>In an explosion of fury the Great Sage left Friar Sand behind as he went up to the other, brandishing his cudgel and shouting abusively, &ldquo;What sort of demon do you think you are? How dare you! You make yourself look like me, you steal my children and grandchildren, you occupy my immortal&rsquo;s cave, and on top of that you live it up like this.&rdquo; When the other Monkey heard al this he did not deign to reply but went for him with his own iron cudgel. When the two Monkeys were together there was no way of tel ing the true from the false. It was a splendid fight: Two cudgels and a pair of monkey spirits,</p>
<p>A couple of truly formidable foes.</p>
<p>906</p>
<p>Both want to escort the Tang emperor&rsquo;s brother; Each longs to achieve what wil make him famous.</p>
<p>The true Monkey now accepts Sakyamuni&rsquo;s teachings; The false demon only pretends to be a Buddhist.</p>
<p>In magic powers and transformations</p>
<p>The false and true are evenly balanced.</p>
<p>One is the Sage Equaling Heaven of primal energy, The other an earth spirit who has long refined his powers.</p>
<p>One wields an As-You-Wil gold-banded cudgel,</p>
<p>The other an iron bar that fol ows the heart&rsquo;s desire.</p>
<p>As they block and parry neither comes out on top.</p>
<p>First they fight each other outside the cave, But soon they carry on the struggle in mid air.</p>
<p>Each of them rose on his clouds and light til they were fighting up in the clouds of the ninth heaven. As Friar Sand stood beside them he dared not intervene in their fight as he real y could not tel the true Monkey from the false one. He longed to draw his sword and join in, but he was frightened of wounding the real Monkey. When he had endured this dilemma for a long time he shot back down to the mountain scar, where he used his demon-quel ing staff to fight his way to the outside of the Water Curtain Cave. Here he sent al the demons fleeing in terror, turned the stone benches over, and smashed the tableware from which they had been eating and drinking to their hearts&rsquo;content. But although he looked everywhere for the blue felt bundles he failed to find them. Now the Water Curtain Cave was so cal ed because the waterfal screening its entrance looked from a distance like a white cloth curtain and only appeared as the waterfal it was from close to.As Friar Sand did not know that the entrance to the cave was behind it he was unable to find the way in, so he took his cloud back up to the Ninth Heaven and started swinging his staff again, stil unable to strike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friar Sand,&rdquo; said the Great Sage, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t help much here. Go back and tel the master what&rsquo;s been happening to us while I drive this demon to Potaraka Island in the Southern Ocean for the Bodhisat va to identify me as the real Monkey.&rdquo; The other Monkey then repeated what he had said.As they looked and sounded exactly the same Friar Sand real y could not tel them apart. He could only do as he was told and ride his cloud back to rejoin the Tang Priest.</p>
<p>907</p>
<p>The two Monkeys meanwhile fought and shouted their way to the Southern Ocean, where they went straight to Potaraka Island stil throwing blows and abuse at each other. Their unending shouts disturbed al the devas who protected the Law, so that they went to the Tide Cave and reported,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bodhisat va, two Sun Wukongs real y have fought their way here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bodhisat va came down from her lotus throne and went with Moksa, the page Sudhana and the Naga Maiden to the entrance, where she shouted,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are, evil beast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each Monkey grabbed hold of the other one while the real one said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bodhisat va, this damned fiend real y does look just like me. Our fight started at the Water Curtain Cave and has been going on for a very long time without get ing anywhere. Friar Sand&rsquo;s mortal eyes are too weak to tel us apart, so he can&rsquo;t help at al . I sent him back West to report to the master while I fought this bloody impostor here for you to distinguish the true from the false. Your eyes are perceptive, Bodhisat va.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other Monkey then said exactly the same. Look long and hard though they did, the devas and the Bodhisat va could not tel which was which. &ldquo;Let go of each other and stand one on each side while I take another look,&rdquo; the Bodhisat va said.</p>
<p>Doing as she told them, the one on her left said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the real Monkey,&rdquo; and the one on her right said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s an impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bodhisat va then cal ed Moksa and Sudhana to her and whispered these instructions: &ldquo;I want one of you to stand very close to each of them while I recite the Band-tightening Spel quietly. The one in agony wil be the real one, and the one who isn&rsquo;t wil be the impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of them went up to each of the Monkeys, but as the Bodhisat va secretly said the words of the spel they both yel ed out in pain, clutched their heads, and rol ed on the ground shouting, &ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; The moment she did they grabbed each other again and went on fighting and shouting. At her wit&rsquo;s end, the Bodhisat va ordered the devas and Moksa to help, but none of them dared strike a blow for fear of wounding the real Monkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sun Wukong,&rdquo; cal ed the Bodhisat va, and both the Monkeys answered her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you were once appointed the Protector of the Horses,&rdquo; said the Bodhisat va, &ldquo;When you made havoc in the Heavenly Palace, al the heavenly generals recognize you. Go to the upper world: let it distinguish between you two. Come back and tel me the result.&rdquo; The Great Sage thanked 908</p>
<p>the Bodhisat va for her kindness and the other Monkey also thanked her.</p>
<p>Pul ing and tugging at each other and keeping up their ceaseless clamour they went straight to the Southern Gate of Heaven, where the Heavenly King Virupaksa led the four heavenly generals Ma, Zhao, Wen and Guan and al the other gate gods great and smal to block the entrance with their weapons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;This is no place for a brawl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sanzang sent me away for kil ing some bandits while I was escorting him to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures,&rdquo; the Great Sage replied. &ldquo;I went to Potaraka to complain. To my horror this evil spirit turned himself into my double, knocked the Tang Priest over and stole the luggage. Friar Sand went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit looking for me and found that this evil spirit had seized my cave. Then he went to Potaraka to tel the Bodhisat va and ask for her help. When he saw me there he made the outrageous accusation that I&rsquo;d got there first by somersault cloud and told the Bodhisat va a pack of lies to cover up. Luckily she could vouch for me and didn&rsquo;t believe Friar Sand, so she sent us both back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to find out what had happened.As you can see, this evil spirit looks just like me. We fought our way from the Water Curtain Cave to Potaraka Island to see the Bodhisat va, but she couldn&rsquo;t tel us apart, so I&rsquo;ve now fought him al the way here in the hope that al the eyes of al the heavens wil be able to see that I&rsquo;m the real Monkey.&rdquo; Then the other Monkey told the same story. No mat er how long they looked al the gods of the heavens could not tel them apart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t tel which is which,&rdquo; the two Monkey shouted, &ldquo;get out of the way and let us go to see the Jade Emperor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the gods could not stop them they opened the gates wide to let them go straight to the Hal of Miraculous Mist. Marshal Ma and the four Heavenly Teachers Zhang, Ge, Xu and Qiu al reported to the Jade Emperor, &ldquo;Two identical Sun Wukongs from the mortal world have charged in through the gates of Heaven and say that they want to see Your Majesty.&rdquo; Before they had finished the two Monkeys came roaring straight in, so alarming the Jade Emperor that he came down from his throne and stood in the palace hal .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you two making such a row in the heavenly palace and shouting in our presence?&rdquo; the Jade Emperor asked. &ldquo;Do you want to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long live Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the Great Sage. &ldquo;Now that I&rsquo;m a devout Buddhist I&rsquo;d never dare try to bul y my bet ers. It&rsquo;s just that this evil spirit has 909</p>
<p>turned himself into my double.&rdquo; He then told the whole story, concluding,</p>
<p>&ldquo;and I beg that Your Majesty wil unmask the impostor.&rdquo; Then the other Monkey said the same thing al over again.</p>
<p>The Jade Emperor ordered Heavenly King Li the Pagoda-carrier to look at them both in his demon-revealing mirror, kil the false one and preserve the true one. The Heavenly King caught them both in his mirror and invited the Jade Emperor and the other deities al to look. Both Monkeys could be seen in it, wearing the same golden band and the same clothes. There was not the slightest difference between them. Unable to tel them apart, the Jade Emperor had both of them driven out of the palace.</p>
<p>The Great Sage gave a mocking laugh and so did the other Monkey. Then they grabbed each other by the hair and by the throat, fought their way out of the heavenly gates, and landed on the road to the West. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see the master,&rdquo; said one of them; and the other replied, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go and see the master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After Friar Sand had taken his leave of the two Monkeys it took him three days and nights&rsquo;travel ing to return to the farm, where he told the Tang Priest everything that had happened. The Tang Priest was ful of regrets: &ldquo;I said that Sun Wukong had hit me and stolen the bundles, never realizing that an evil spirit had turned itself into an imitation Monkey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evil spirit made doubles of yourself, the white horse, Pig carrying our luggage, and me,&rdquo; said Friar Sand. &ldquo;I was so furious that I kil ed the fake Friar Sand: he was real y a monkey spirit. That made them al run away, then I went to tel the Bodhisat va my troubles. She sent Monkey and me back to identify the demon, but he was so much like the real Monkey that I couldn&rsquo;t help in the fight, which is why I&rsquo;ve come back to report to you, Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanzang paled with horror at this news, while Pig roared with laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great, great,&rdquo; he guffawed. &ldquo;Just as this kind old lady said, there are several lots of pilgrims going to fetch the scriptures. They&rsquo;re one lot, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone in the house, young and old alike, came to ask Friar Sand, &ldquo;Where have you been looking for money for your travel ing expenses these last few days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the Eastern Continent of Superior Body to look for my eldest brother and fetch the baggage,&rdquo; Friar Sand replied with a smile. &ldquo;Then I went to Potaraka Island in the Southern Ocean to see the Bodhisat va Guanyin and to the Mountain of Flowers and 910</p>
<p>Fruit again before coming back here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long was your return journey?&rdquo; the old man of the family asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About 70,000 miles,&rdquo; Friar Sand replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be a very long way to walk in only a few days,&rdquo; the old man said, &ldquo;You must have gone by cloud to get there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How else do you think he got across the sea?&rdquo; said Pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you and I do is like walking compared with Monkey: he&rsquo;d have been there and back in a day or two,&rdquo; said Friar Sand. When the family heard this they realized that they must al be gods or immortals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said Pig, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re senior to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were talking they were interrupted by a noisy quarrel in mid air, and when they rushed out to look they saw two Monkeys fighting. The sight made Pig&rsquo;s hands itch. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up to tel them apart,&rdquo; he said, and with that the splendid idiot leapt up into the air and shouted, &ldquo;Stop yel ing, brother, Pig&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit the evil spirit,&rdquo; both Monkeys shouted, &ldquo;hit the evil spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Al this both horrified and delighted the family, who exclaimed, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a whole lot of arhats who can ride on clouds staying with us. Even if we&rsquo;d made a vow to feed monks we would never have been able to feed such holy men as these.&rdquo; They were now more generous with their food and tea than ever. Then they began to worry that if the fight between the two Sun the Novices turned nasty, heaven and earth might be turned upside down: it could be disastrous.</p>
<p>Seeing that behind the old man&rsquo;s delight lay these deep misgivings Sanzang said to him, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need to worry or alarm yourself, benefactor. When I made him submit and become my disciple he gave up evil and turned to good. Of course we wil show you our gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be too great an honour,&rdquo; the old man replied, &ldquo;too great an honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop talking now, benefactor,&rdquo; said Friar Sand, &ldquo;and you sit here, Master. Pig and I&rsquo;l each bring one of them back here to stand in front of you. When you say the spel the one who suffers wil be the real Monkey and the one who doesn&rsquo;t wil be the impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a very good idea,&rdquo; said Sanzang.</p>
<p>Friar Sand then rose up into mid-air and said, &ldquo;Stop it, both of you. I&rsquo;m taking you for the master to choose between you.&rdquo; The Great Sage then let go of his 911</p>
<p>opponent, and so did the other Monkey. Friar Sand held one and told Pig to hold the other, and they took them both down by their clouds til they stood in front of the thatched cot age.</p>
<p>As soon as he saw them Sanzang began to say the Band-tightening Spel , at which both Monkeys cried out together, &ldquo;Why do you have to say that spel when we&rsquo;re fighting so hard? Stop! Stop!&rdquo; Being a kind and merciful man the venerable elder stopped reciting the spel before he had been able to tel them apart. The two Monkeys then broke free from Pig and Friar Sand and started fighting again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brothers,&rdquo; the Great Sage said, &ldquo;look after the master while I fight this impostor down to get the Kings of the Underworld to tel which of us is which.&rdquo; The other Monkey said likewise, and the two of them soon disappeared, grabbing and tugging at each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friar Sand,&rdquo; said Pig, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t you grab the luggage off the fake Pig when you saw him carrying it at the Water Curtain Cave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The evil spirits surrounded me when I kil ed my double with the demon-quel ing staff,&rdquo; Friar Sand replied. &ldquo;They were going to get me, so I had to flee for my life. After I&rsquo;d been to see the Bodhisat va and gone back to the cave entrance again with Monkey I overturned al their stone benches and scat ered the lit le demons, but I couldn&rsquo;t see any entrance to the cave, only a waterfal . I came back empty-handed as I couldn&rsquo;t find the luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tel you something,&rdquo; said Pig. &ldquo;When I went there a few years ago to ask him to come back we met outside the cave. After I&rsquo;d persuaded him to come he jumped down and went into the cave to change. I saw him go straight through the water: the waterfal is the entrance. I bet that&rsquo;s where that devil has put our luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you know the way into the cave I think you&rsquo;d bet er go and fetch our baggage from there while the demon&rsquo;s away,&rdquo; said Sanzang. &ldquo;Even if Wukong does come back I stil won&rsquo;t have him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off then,&rdquo; said Pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are thousands and thousands of lit le monkeys in front of the cave,&rdquo;</p>
<p>said Friar Sand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be terrible if they were too much for you by yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not worried,&rdquo; said Pig, who rushed outside and headed off to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to fetch the luggage.</p>
<p>The two Monkeys fought their way round to the back of the Dark Mountain of the Underworld, where al the demons shivered and shook with terror as 912</p>
<p>they hid themselves. The ones who managed to run away first rushed straight to the Underworld government offices and reported to the Senluo Palace,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesties, two Great Sages Equaling Heaven have come to the Dark Mountain and are fighting their way here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Ring of Qinguang in the First Palace reported this with alarm to the King of Chujiang in the Second Palace. The news was passed on in turn to King Songdi in the Third Palace, the King of Biancheng in the Fourth Palace, King Yama in the Fifth Palace, King Impartial in the Sixth Palace, the King of Taishan in the Seventh Palace, the Metropolitan King in the Eighth Palace, King Wuguan in the Ninth Palace, and King Everturning Wheel in the Tenth Palace. In an instant the Ten Kings al gathered together and sent an urgent message to King Ksitigarbha. Meanwhile the Underworld forces were mustered in the Senluo Palace ready to capture the true and the false Monkey.</p>
<p>Just then there was the roar of a mighty wind as dreary mists fil ed the air and the two Monkeys came tumbling and rol ing to the Senluo Palace.</p>
<p>The Lords of the Underworld stepped forward to block their way and say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Sages, why are you making such disorder in our Underworld?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the real Great Sage replied, &ldquo;I was escorting the Tang Priest on his journey to fetch the scriptures from the Western Heaven when bandits tried to rob him on a mountain in the land of Western Liang. He got angry with me when I kil ed a few of them and sent me away. I went to tel my troubles to the Bodhisat va in the Southern Ocean. I never imagined that this demon would have the effrontery to turn himself into my double, at ack my master on the road, and steal our baggage. When my fel ow-disciple Friar Sand went back to my mountain to fetch the baggage he found that the demon had created an imitation of the master to take to the Western Heaven and fetch the scriptures, so he rushed to the Southern Ocean to see the Bodhisat va Guanyin and found me there at her side. After he&rsquo;d told his story the Bodhisat va sent me back to the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit with him to see what was going on. I found that this bastard had stolen my cave. We argued al the way to the Bodhisat va Guanyin&rsquo;s place, but she couldn&rsquo;t tel which of us was the real me. Then I fought with him up to Heaven, where none of the gods knew which of us was which, and after that went to see the master. When the master recited the Band-tightening Spel my double was in just as much pain as I was. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve brought this chaos to the Underworld in the hope that Your Majesties wil look up the Registers of 913</p>
<p>Life and Death for me to find out about the False Sun the Novice&rsquo;s background so that I can catch his soul and end this confusion of there being two minds.&rdquo; The demon then said the same thing.</p>
<p>The Lords of the Underworld cal ed on the judges in charge of the records to go through them careful y from beginning to end. There was nobody under the name of False Sun the Novice. They checked through the registers of hairy beasts again, and found that under item 130 in the monkey section there was a record of how the Great Sage Sun had achieved the Way in his youth, made havoc in the Underworld and removed his name from the registers of death, so that from then on none of the monkeys were listed. When the judges had made their inspection they reported back to the palace.</p>
<p>Holding their tablets of office, the Lords of the Underworld said to Monkey,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Sage, there are no names in the records that can be checked. You wil have to go back to the world of the living to be told apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they were saying this they heard the Bodhisat va King Ksitigarbha shout,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, wait! I&rsquo;l send Examiner to tel you apart.&rdquo; Now Examiner was the name of an animal who lay under the Bodhisat va Ksitigarbha&rsquo;s sutra table.</p>
<p>Just by lying there he could tel good from evil and wise from stupid among any of the snails, fish, hairy creatures, feathered creatures, insects, heavenly immortals, earthly immortals, divine immortals, human immortals and devil immortals in al the mountains, rivers and countries of the four great continents, in al cave heavens and in al blessed places. The animal lay on the ground in the courtyard of the Senluo Palace as Ksitigarbha instructed it.</p>
<p>A lit le later it raised its head and said to Ksitigarbha, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found the name of the demon, but I cannot say it to his face, nor can I help catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would happen if you identified him to his face?&rdquo; Ksitigarbha asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did,&rdquo; Examiner replied, &ldquo;I am afraid that the evil spirit would turn nasty, make disorder in the palace and destroy the peace of the Underworld.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why won&rsquo;t you help capture him?&rdquo; Ksitigarbha went on to ask, and Examiner replied, &ldquo;The evil spirit&rsquo;s magic powers are no less than those of Sun Wukong. No mat er how much dharma power the gods of the Underworld have, they would never be able to catch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, how is the evil spirit to be got rid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boundless is the Buddha&rsquo;s Dharma,&rdquo; Examiner replied. Ksitigarbha was now enlightened. &ldquo;As you two look the same and have the same magic powers,&rdquo; he said to both Monkeys, &ldquo;if you want to be told apart you wil 914</p>
<p>have to go to Sakyamuni Buddha in Thunder Monastery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; they both replied together, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve right. You and I&rsquo;l go to the Western Heaven to be told apart by the Lord Buddha.&rdquo; They then took their leave of Ksitigarbha and were seen out by the Ten Kings of the Underworld as they went up to the Turquoise Cloud Palace, after which devils were sent to close the entrance to the Underworld.</p>
<p>Watch the two Monkeys as they fly by cloud and mist to the Western Heaven.</p>
<p>There is a poem about it that goes,</p>
<p>Troubles arise if one has two minds;</p>
<p>Doubts cloud everything from sea to sky.</p>
<p>One desires fine horses and the highest rank, Craving for eminence at the royal court.</p>
<p>Fighting North and South without respite,</p>
<p>They parry to East and West with never a pause.</p>
<p>In dhyana the secret of mindlessness must be learned; Nourish the babe in silence and form the holy foetus.</p>
<p>The two of them fought as they flew through the air, grabbing, tugging, pul ing and snatching at each other, al the way to the outside of the Thunder Monastery on Vulture Peak in the Western Heaven. Even before they arrived the four Bodhisat vas, the eight vajrapanis, the five hundred arhats, the three thousand protectors, the nuns, monks, lay people and al the holy hosts were standing beneath the seven-precious lotus throne listening to the Tathagata expounding the Dharma. This is what he was explaining: There is existence in non-existence, non-existence in non-non-existence. There is mat er in non-mat er, emptiness in non-emptiness. What exists is non-existent, and what does not exist is not non-existent. Non-mat er is mat er; non-emptiness is emptiness. Emptiness is emptiness and mat er is mat er. Mat er is not permanent mat er, mat er is empty. Emptiness is not permanent emptiness, emptiness is mat er. Know that emptiness is not empty and that mat er is not mat er. This is what is meant by insight and understanding the Wonderful Voice.</p>
<p>Al the host kowtowed in submission. Amid the sound of chanting the Tathagata released a shower of heavenly petals, left his throne and said to them. &ldquo;You are al of one mind. Watch the struggle of two minds coming here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They al raised their eyes to look and saw the two Monkeys come shouting 915</p>
<p>and yel ing to the holy Thunder Peak. The eight vajrapanis were so alarmed that they stepped forward to block their way and say, &ldquo;Where do you two think you are going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This evil spirit has turned himself into my double,&rdquo; Monkey replied, &ldquo;so I wish to go to the lotus throne to ask the Tathagata to tel that I am the real Sun Wukong and he is an impostor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the vajrapanis could not stop them they yel ed at each other right to the foot of the lotus throne, where they kowtowed and each of them said, &ldquo;Your disciple has been escorting the Tang Priest here to fetch the true scriptures.</p>
<p>Goodness only knows how much effort I&rsquo;ve spent dealing with demons and capturing monsters along the way. Recently we were robbed by bandits, and I admit that I did twice kil some of them. The master was so angry with me that he sent me back and wouldn&rsquo;t let me come with him to worship your golden self. The only thing I could do was to go back to the Southern Ocean to tel my troubles to Guanyin. I never imagined that this evil spirit would make himself look and sound just like me, knock the master over, and steal our luggage. My brother Friar Sand went to my mountain looking for me and this monster talked a whole lot of fancy nonsense about having his own holy monk to go and fetch the scriptures. When Friar Sand got away and fled to the Southern Ocean to tel the whole story to Guanyin she sent us both back to my mountain. After that the two of us, the real me and the impostor side by side, fought our way to the Southern Ocean, Heaven, the Tang Priest and the Underworld, but nobody could tel which of us was which. That is why I&rsquo;ve had the effrontery to come here to beg you in your infinite charity and mercy to identify me as the true Sun Wukong. Then I&rsquo;l be able to escort the Tang Priest here to worship you in person and fetch the scriptures to take back to the East, so that the great teachings wil be made known for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing the two of them saying the same things in the same voice, none of the host could tel them apart: only the Tathagata himself knew. He was just about to expose the impostor when a coloured cloud brought Guanyin from the South to see our Buddha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble Guanyin,&rdquo; said our Buddha, put ing his hands together in front of his chest, &ldquo;can you tel the true Sun the Novice from the false one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not tel them apart when they visited my island,&rdquo; the Bodhisat va replied. &ldquo;Since then they have been to Heaven and the Underworld, and stil nobody could say which was which. That is why I have come to beg you, 916</p>
<p>Tathagata, to identify the true Sun Wukong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this the Buddha replied with a smile, &ldquo;You al have very great dharma powers, but you can only scan everything that happens under the sky. You cannot know al the creatures and categories under the sky.&rdquo; When the Bodhisat va asked what these categories were, the Buddha replied, &ldquo;There are five kinds of immortal: heavenly, earthly, divine, human and demonic. There are five kinds of beast: snail, scaly, furry, feathered and insect. This wretch is not heavenly, earthly, divine, human or demonic. He is not a snail, or scaly, or furry, or feathered or an insect. Now there are also four kinds of ape that cause confusion and don&rsquo;t come under any of the ten categories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask what these four kinds of ape are?&rdquo; the Bodhisat va asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first kind is the intel igent stone monkey,&rdquo; the Buddha replied. &ldquo;He can do al kinds of transformation, knows al about the seasons of Heaven and earthly advantages, and can move the stars and their constel ations about.</p>
<p>The second kind is the red-rumped mandril that knows al about the Yin and the Yang and human affairs, can go into or out of anywhere, and knows how to prolong its life and avoid death. The third kind is the magic-armed gibbon that can catch the sun or moon, shrink mountains, see what is auspicious and what is not, and fool around with heaven and earth. The fourth kind is the six-eared macaque which has wonderful hearing and perception. It knows about the past and the future and understands al creatures. These four kinds of ape do not come within any of the ten categories and are not listed among the creatures that live between heaven and earth. I can see that the false Sun Wukong is just such a six-eared macaque. Wherever he stands he can know what is happening hundreds of miles away and hear everything that is said.</p>
<p>That is why he has such wonderful hearing, bril iant perception, and knowledge of the past, the future, and al beings; that is why he looks and sounds just like Wukong. He is a six-eared macaque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as the macaque heard the Tathagata Buddha say who he real y was, he started shaking with fear and took a great leap to get away. The Tathagata at once ordered his hosts to strike, and the macaque was immediately surrounded by the four Bodhisat vas, eight vajrapanis, five hundred arhats, three thousand protectors, and al the monks, nuns and lay people, as wel as Guanyin and Moksa. The Great Sage Monkey rushed forward too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hit him, Wukong,&rdquo; said the Tathagata. &ldquo;I shal capture him for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The macaque&rsquo;s fur stood on end as he realized that there would be no escape, 917</p>
<p>so he shook himself and turned straight into a bee who started to fly straight up, only to fal down again as the Tathagata&rsquo;s golden begging bowl was clapped over him. The host al thought he had got away. &ldquo;Stop talking,&rdquo; said the Buddha with a smile. &ldquo;The evil spirit has not escaped. He is under my bowl.&rdquo; They al surged forward to see him in his true form of a six-eared macaque as the bowl was lifted.</p>
<p>The Great Sage could not restrain himself. Swinging his iron cudgel he kil ed the demon with a single blow to the head, and that is why this species is now extinct. It was more than the Tathagata could bear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is terrible,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is terrible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be sorry for him,&rdquo; said the Great Sage. &ldquo;He wounded my master and stole our bundles.According to the law he should get his head cut off for wounding in the course of theft and daylight robbery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go back at once to escort the Tang Priest here to fetch the scriptures,&rdquo; said the Tathagata.</p>
<p>The Great Sage kowtowed to him in thanks and said, &ldquo;I wish to report to the Tathagata that my master definitely refuses to have me. The journey would be a lot of trouble for nothing. I beg you in your kindness, Tathagata, to say the Band-loosening Spel . Then I can take this gold band off and give it back to you, and you can let me return to lay life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop those sil y ideas and behave yourself,&rdquo; said the Tathagata. &ldquo;I shal send Guanyin to take you back to him. Of course he&rsquo;l accept you. Protect him wel , and when you succeed and reach ultimate bliss there wil be a place on a lotus throne for you too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Bodhisat va Guanyin heard this she put her hands together to thank him for his mercy then took Wukong off by cloud fol owed by Moksa and the white parrot. They were soon back at the thatched cot age by the road.As soon as Friar Sand saw them he hurried out to ask the master to greet the Bodhisat va at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tang Priest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it was a six-eared macaque pretending to be Wukong who hit you the other day. Fortunately the Tathagata could tel who he was, and Wukong has now kil ed him. You must now take Wukong back. There are many demon obstacles on the way ahead and you must have his protection if you are to reach Vulture Peak, see the Buddha and fetch the scriptures, so stop being angry with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shal respectful y obey,&rdquo; Sanzang replied.</p>
<p>918</p>
<p>Just as he was kowtowing in thanks there was the roar of a whirlwind from the East carrying Pig with the two bundles on his back. Seeing the Bodhisat va the idiot kowtowed to her and said, &ldquo;Your disciple left the master the other day and went back to the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit to look for this luggage. I found the imitation Tang Priest and imitation Pig and kil ed the pair of them. They were both monkeys. Then I went inside and found the bundles. Nothing&rsquo;s missing&mdash;I&rsquo;ve checked them over. So I came straight back by wind. What happened to the two Monkeys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bodhisat va then told him how the Tathagata had told the two of them apart. The idiot was delighted and gave thanks at great length. Master and disciples then said farewel to the Bodhisat va, who went back to the sea.</p>
<p>The four of them were now once more of a single wil and a single mind; al grievances had been washed away and anger removed. They thanked their hosts in the thatched cot age, retied the luggage, saddled up the horse, and headed West. Indeed:</p>
<p>A separation on the journey muddled the Five Elements; At the demon-subduing gathering enlightenment returned.</p>
<p>The spirit returned to the house of the mind and dhyana was calmed; When the six perceptions were control ed the elixir was completed.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know how long it was til Sanzang saw the Buddha and asked for the scriptures after set ing out again listen to the explanation in the next instal ment.</p>
