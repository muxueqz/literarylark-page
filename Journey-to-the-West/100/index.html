<p>Outside the gates the Protectors of the Four Quarters and the Centre, the Four Duty Gods, the Six Dings, the Six Jias and the Guardians of the Faith went up to the Bodhisat va Guanyin and said, &ldquo;We, your disciples, have given secret help to the holy monk in obedience to your dharma command, Bodhisat va. Now that they have fulfil ed their deeds and you have reported your mission accomplished to the Lord Buddha, we would like to report the completion of our mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permission granted.&rdquo; The Bodhisat va replied with delight, &ldquo;permission granted.&rdquo; The Bodhisat va then went on to ask, &ldquo;What were the thoughts and actions of the Tang Priest and his three disciples on their journey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They real y were pious and determined,&rdquo; the deities al replied, &ldquo;as we are sure wil not have escaped your profound perception. But the Tang Priest&rsquo;s sufferings truly beggar description. Your disciples have made a careful record of the disasters and hardships that he has endured on his journey. This is the account of his ordeals.&rdquo; The Bodhisat va read it through from the beginning, and this is what was writ en in it:</p>

<p>And the ordeals of the holy monk are al clearly recorded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Casting her eyes over the record, the Bodhisat va quickly said, &ldquo;In the Buddha&rsquo;s school &rsquo;nine nines&rsquo; are needed before one can come to the truth.</p>
<p>The eighty ordeals that the holy monk has endured are one short of the ful number. &ldquo;Go after the vajrapanis,&rdquo; she ordered a protector, &ldquo;and tel them to create another ordeal.&rdquo; The protector headed East by cloud as soon as he was given this order, and after a day and a night he caught up with the Eight Vajrapanis. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like this, you see,&rdquo; he said, whispering in their ears in explanation, adding, &ldquo;so you must do as the Bodhisat va commands and not disobey.&rdquo; When the Eight Vajrapanis heard this they stopped the wind with a swishing sound and dropped the four of them to the ground, horse, scriptures and al . Oh dear! It was a case of The Way of reaching the truth through the nine nines is hard; Hold fast to your determination to stand at the mysterious pass.</p>
<p>Only through rigorous effort can the demons be repel ed; Perseverance is essential to the true Dharma&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>Do not mistake the scriptures for something easily won; Of many a kind were the hardships endured by the holy monk.</p>
<p>The marvel ous union has always been hard to achieve: The slightest mistake and the elixir wil not be made.</p>
<p>As his feet touched common ground Sanzang felt alarmed. &ldquo;Marvel ous,&rdquo;</p>
<p>said Pig, roaring with laughter, &ldquo;just marvel ous! It&rsquo;s a case of more haste less 1567</p>
<p>speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It real y is marvel ous,&rdquo; said Friar Sand. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re giving us a rest here after going so fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the saying goes,&rdquo; remarked the Great Sage, &ldquo;&lsquo;Wait ten days on a sandbank, then cross nine in a single day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop arguing, you three,&rdquo; said Sanzang. &ldquo;Find out which way we have come and where we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here!&rdquo; said Friar Sand after looking al around, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re here! Listen to the water, Master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the sound of the water I suppose it must be your family home,&rdquo;</p>
<p>observed Brother Monkey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His home is the River of Flowing Sands,&rdquo; said Pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not that,&rdquo; replied Friar Sand. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the River of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take a careful look at the other side, disciple,&rdquo; said Sanzang, at which Monkey sprang into the air, shaded his eyes with his hand, and took a careful look around. &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; he said after coming down again, &ldquo;this is the West bank of the River of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember now,&rdquo; said Sanzang. &ldquo;On the East bank there is Chen Family Vil age. When we came here the other year they were so grateful to us for rescuing their son and daughter that they wanted to build a boat to take us across, but the White Soft-shel ed Turtle carried us over. As I recal , there was no sign of human life anywhere on the West bank. Whatever are we to do now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say that common mortals can be sinners,&rdquo; said Pig, &ldquo;but the vajrapanis who serve the Buddha in person are too. The Buddha ordered them to bring us back East, so why have they dropped us half way home? We&rsquo;re stuck here now. How ever are we going to get over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop complaining, brother,&rdquo; said Friar Sand. &ldquo;Our master has found the Way. He cast off his mortal body at the Cloud-touching Crossing, so he won&rsquo;t possibly fal into the water now. Our big brother and we two can al do levitation magic, so we can carry the master across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey laughed to himself under his breath as he replied, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t do it, we can&rsquo;t do it.&rdquo; Why do you think he said that they couldn&rsquo;t do it? If he had been prepared to use his divine powers and give away the secret of flying then master and disciples would have been able to cross a thousand rivers.</p>
<p>But he understood that as the Tang Priest had not yet completed the nine 1568</p>
<p>nines he was fated to undergo another ordeal, which was why he had been held up here.</p>
<p>Talking as they walked slowly along, master and disciples headed straight to the river-bank, where al of a sudden they heard someone cal ing, &ldquo;This way, Tang Priest, this way!&rdquo; They were al surprised, and when they looked up there was no sign of anyone around, and no boat either.</p>
<p>There was only a big, white, scabby-headed soft-shel ed turtle raising its head by the bank and cal ing, &ldquo;Master, I have been waiting for you al these years. Why have you only just come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We troubled you in the past, old turtle,&rdquo; said Monkey with a smile, &ldquo;and this year we meet again.&rdquo; Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand were al delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you real y do want to look after us, come ashore,&rdquo; Monkey said, at which the turtle climbed out of the river with a bound. Monkey had the horse tied to the turtle with Pig squat ing behind the horse&rsquo;s tail. The Tang Priest stood to the left of the horse&rsquo;s neck and Friar Sand to its right, while Monkey stood with one foot on the turtle&rsquo;s neck and the other on his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take it easy and take it steady,&rdquo; he said. The turtle strode across the water just as if his four feet were walking on flat land, carrying the master and his three disciples, five of them altogether including the horse, straight back to the Eastern bank. This was Indeed:</p>
<p>The mystery of the Dharma within the unique sect: When the demons are al defeated man and heaven are made known.</p>
<p>Only now can the original face be seen,</p>
<p>And the causes of the one body al be complete.</p>
<p>Hold to the Three Vehicles to come and go at wil ; After the elixir&rsquo;s nine transformations you may do what you like.</p>
<p>Carry your bundle, let your staff fly, and understand the inexpressible; Lucky they were on their return to meet the Ancient Turtle.</p>
<p>Carrying them on his back, the Ancient Soft-shel ed Turtle walked across the waves for the best part of a day. It was nearly evening when, as they approached the East bank, he suddenly asked, &ldquo;Venerable master, some years ago I begged you when you reached the West and saw our Tathagata Buddha to ask him when I would be converted and how long I would live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now ever since the venerable elder had reached the Western Heaven, bathed in the Jade Truth Temple, cast off his mortal body at the Cloud-touching Crossing and walked up the Vulture Peak, his heart had been set only on 1569</p>
<p>worshipping the Buddha; and when he met al the Buddhas, Bodhisat vas, holy monks and others his whole mind had been devoted to fetching the scriptures. He had given no at ention to anything else, and so had not asked about how long the Ancient Turtle would live. Having nothing he could say, and not daring to lie to or deceive the turtle, Sanzang was quiet for a long time and gave no reply. When the turtle realized that Sanzang had not asked the questions on his behalf he gave a shake of his head and submerged with a loud splash, dropping the four of them, horse, scriptures and al , into the water.</p>
<p>Oh dear! But luckily the Tang Priest had cast off his mortal body and achieved the Way. If he had stil been as he had before he would have sunk to the bot om. It was also lucky that the white horse was a dragon, that Pig and Friar Sand could swim, and that Brother Monkey gave a smiling and magnificent display of his great magic powers as he lifted the Tang Priest out of the water and up the East bank. The only thing was that the bundles of scriptures, the clothes and the saddle were al soaked.</p>
<p>Master and disciples had climbed up the bank to get themselves sorted out when a sudden fierce wind blew up, the sky turned dark, and amid thunder and lightning stones and sand flew al around. This is what could be seen:</p>
<p>A wind</p>
<p>Throwing heaven and earth into chaos;</p>
<p>Thunder</p>
<p>Rocking mountains and rivers;</p>
<p>Lightning</p>
<p>Flying like fire through the clouds;</p>
<p>Mists</p>
<p>Covering al of the earth.</p>
<p>The wind howled;</p>
<p>Loud roared the thunder.</p>
<p>The lightning streaked red,</p>
<p>While clouds blocked out the moon and the stars.</p>
<p>The wind-blown dust drove into the face,</p>
<p>And tigers and leopards hid in terror.</p>
<p>The lightning flashes set birds cawing,</p>
<p>And tress al vanished in the spreading mists.</p>
<p>1570</p>
<p>The wind whipped up the waves of the River of Heaven; The thunder terrified the fish and dragons in the River of Heaven; The lightning lit up the whole of River of Heaven; The mists enshrouded in darkness the banks of the River of Heaven.</p>
<p>Splendid wind!</p>
<p>Mountains toppled; pines and bamboo fel .</p>
<p>Splendid thunder!</p>
<p>Its majesty alarmed insects and spread terror.</p>
<p>Splendid lightning!</p>
<p>It moved across the sky and lit up the wilds like golden snakes.</p>
<p>Splendid mist!</p>
<p>Darkening the whole of space, obscuring the nine heavens.</p>
<p>This alarmed Sanzang, who pressed down on the bundles of scriptures, while Friar Sand held down their carrying-pole and Pig clung to the white horse.</p>
<p>Monkey, however, swung his iron cudgel around with both hands as he kept guard to both right and left.</p>
<p>Now the wind, mist, thunder and lightning were al signals made by evil demons who wanted to steal the scriptures that had been fetched. They tried al night to grab them until the dawn; only then did they stop.</p>
<p>The venerable elder, whose clothes were al soaking wet, shivered and shook as he said, &ldquo;How did al this start, Wukong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; Brother Monkey replied, snorting with fury, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t understand the inner truth. By escorting you to fetch these scriptures we have won the great achievement of heaven and earth. You wil enjoy perpetual youth, and your dharma body wil never decay. This is something heaven and earth can&rsquo;t stand for, and the demons and gods detest. They wanted to come and steal them in the darkness. But because the scriptures were soaked through and your true dharma body was holding them down, the thunder could not bombard them, the lightning could not il uminate them and the mist could not obscure them. It was also because I whirled my iron cudgel around to make its pure Positive nature protect them. Since dawn the Positive has been in the ascendant again, which is why they can&rsquo;t take them now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only then did Sanzang, Pig and Friar Sand realize what had happened and al express unbounded thanks. A lit le later, when the sun was shining from high in the sky, they took the scriptures to the top of a high cliff, opened the bundles and put them out to dry. The rocks on which the scriptures were 1571</p>
<p>dried in the sun remain there to this day. Then they spread their clothes and shoes out to dry beside the cliff while they stood there, sat down, or leapt around. Indeed:</p>
<p>The pure Positive body was happy in the sun,</p>
<p>When Negative demons dared not use their might.</p>
<p>Even when water is dominant the true scriptures wil win, Not fearing wind or thunder, lightning, mist or light.</p>
<p>After this clarification they come to the true perception; From now on they wil reach the immortals&rsquo; land in peace.</p>
<p>On the rocks where the scriptures were dried their traces stil remain; Never again wil any demons come back to this place.</p>
<p>As the four of them were checking through the scriptures and drying them in the sun one by one some fishermen who were passing the river bank lifted up their heads and saw them there.</p>
<p>One of the fishermen recognized them and said, &ldquo;Venerable teachers, didn&rsquo;t you cross this river the other year when you were on your way to the Western Heaven to fetch the scriptures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Pig, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s right. Where are you from? How did you know who we are?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re from Chen Vil age,&rdquo; the fisherman replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far is Chen Vil age from here?&rdquo; Pig asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s seven miles South from this gulch,&rdquo; the fisherman said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take the scriptures to Chen Vil age and dry them there,&rdquo; said Pig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somewhere we can stay there, and we&rsquo;l be able to get something to eat. Besides, we can get their family to wash our clothes. That&rsquo;l be best, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wil not go there,&rdquo; said Sanzang. &ldquo;When we have dried everything here we can pack up and find our way back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fishermen, who passed the gulch to the South, happened to meet Chen Cheng. &ldquo;You two old gentlemen,&rdquo; they cal ed, &ldquo;the teachers who went to be sacrificed instead of your children the other year have come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you see them?&rdquo; Chen Cheng asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drying their scriptures in the sun on the rocks,&rdquo; the fishermen replied.</p>
<p>Chen Cheng then took several of his tenants across the gulch, saw the pilgrims, and hurried towards them to kneel and say, &ldquo;My lords, now that you are coming back with your scriptures, your achievement completed and 1572</p>
<p>your deeds done, why don&rsquo;t you come to my house? Why are you hanging around here? Won&rsquo;t you please come straight to the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;l go with you when we&rsquo;ve dried our scriptures in the sun,&rdquo; Monkey replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did your scriptures and clothes al get wet, my lords?&rdquo; Chen Cheng asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other year the White soft-shel ed Turtle kindly carried us West across the river,&rdquo; Sanzang replied, &ldquo;and this year he carried us across it Eastwards.</p>
<p>We were approaching the bank when he put some questions to me about the enquiries he had asked me to make with the Lord Buddha about how long he would live. Now I never made this enquiry, so he soaked us al in the water.</p>
<p>That was how they got wet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanzang then told the whole story in al its details, and as Chen Cheng was so sincere in pressing his invitation Sanzang could do nothing but pack up the scriptures. As it was not realized that the ends of several rol s of the Buddhacaritakavya sutra had stuck to the rock when wet, the ends were torn off, which is why the Buddhacaritakavya sutra is incomplete to this day and there are stil traces of writing on the rocks where the scriptures were dried in the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were careless,&rdquo; Sanzang said with remorse. &ldquo;We did not pay enough at ention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong,&rdquo; said Monkey with a laugh, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re wrong. Heaven and earth are incomplete and this scripture used to be complete. Now it&rsquo;s been soaked and torn to fulfil the mystery of incompleteness. This is not something that could have been achieved through human effort.&rdquo; When master and disciples had finished packing the surras they returned with Chen Chang to his vil age.</p>
<p>In the vil age one person told ten, ten told a hundred, and a hundred a thousand, til al of them, young and old, came out to welcome and see the pilgrims. As soon as Chen Qing heard of it he had an incense table set out to greet them in front of the gates; he also ordered drummers and players of wind instruments to perform. A moment later the travelers arrived and were welcomed and taken inside. Chen Qing led out his whole household to greet them with bows and thank them for their earlier kindness in saving their son and daughter. Tea and a vegetarian meal were then ordered; but since receiving the immortal food and immortal delicacies of the Lord Buddha and 1573</p>
<p>casting off his mortal body to become a Buddha, Sanzang had lost al desire for mortals&rsquo; food. As the two old men&rsquo;s urgings were so insistent, he took some of the food as a mark of gratitude.</p>
<p>The Great Sage Monkey had never been one to eat cooked food, so he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wil be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Friar Sand did not eat either, and even Pig was not the Pig he used to be: he soon put his bowl down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you eating any more either, idiot?&rdquo; Monkey asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why,&rdquo; Pig said, &ldquo;but my stomach&rsquo;s gone weak al of a sudden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vegetarian banquet was then cleared away as the old men asked about how they had fetched the scriptures. Sanzang then gave them a detailed account that started with the bath in the Jade Truth Temple and the lightening of their bodies at Cloud-touching Crossing and went on to tel how they had seen the Tathagata at Thunder Monastery, been feasted at the jeweled tower, given the scriptures in the precious library&mdash;wordless scriptures at first because when the two arhats had demanded presents they had refused them&mdash;had gone back to pay their respects to the Tathagata again to be given the number of rol s in a single store, had been plunged into the water by the White Soft-shel ed Turtle, and nearly had the scriptures stolen in the darkness by evil spirits. After tel ing al this Sanzang took his leave.</p>
<p>But the whole family of the two old men was not at al wil ing to let them go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have been under a great debt to you for saving our children that we have not yet been able to repay,&rdquo; they said. &ldquo;We have built a Temple of Deliverance where incense has been burned to you ever since without ceasing.&rdquo; Then they cal ed out the children in whose place Monkey and Pig had gone to be sacrificed, Chen Guan-given and Pan of Gold, to kowtow in thanks and ask them into the shrine to take a look. Sanzang then put the bundles of scriptures in front of the hal of their house and read them one rol of the Precious Eternity sutra. Then they went to the temple, where the Chens had set out delicacies. Before the pilgrims could sit down another group of people came to invite them to another meal, and before they could pick up their chopsticks yet another group came with a third invitation. This went on and on without end, so that they had no chance to eat properly. Sanzang, who dared not decline the invitations, had to make gestures of eating. The shrine was indeed most handsomely built:</p>
<p>The gateway was thickly painted in red</p>
<p>1574</p>
<p>Thanks to the generous donors.</p>
<p>A tower rose there</p>
<p>Where houses with a pair of cloisters had now been built.</p>
<p>Red were the doors</p>
<p>And the Seven Treasures were finely carved.</p>
<p>Incense floated up to the clouds;</p>
<p>Pure light fil ed the vault of space.</p>
<p>Some tender cypress saplings were stil being watered; A number of pine trees did not yet form a grove.</p>
<p>Living waters met one in front</p>
<p>Where the waves of the River of Heaven were rol ing; High cliffs rose behind</p>
<p>Where range upon range of mountains joined the earth dragon.</p>
<p>When Sanzang has seen everything he climbed the high tower, where statues of the four pilgrims had been placed. &ldquo;Looks just like you, brother,&rdquo; said pig, tugging at Monkey, when he saw them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Second brother,&rdquo; said Friar Sand, &ldquo;Your statue&rsquo;s just like you too. The only thing is that the master&rsquo;s is too good-looking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very good,&rdquo; said Sanzang, &ldquo;it is very good.&rdquo; They then came downstairs, where people were stil waiting, and urged them to eat the vegetarian food that was set out in the hal and in the cloisters behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened to the Great King&rsquo;s Temple that used to be here?&rdquo; Brother Monkey asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was demolished that year,&rdquo; the old men replied. &ldquo;My lords, we have had good harvests every year since this monastery was established, thanks to your lordships&rsquo; blessed protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was heaven&rsquo;s gift,&rdquo; said Monkey with a smile, &ldquo;nothing to do with us.</p>
<p>But after we have gone this time I guarantee that the families in your vil age wil have many sons and grandsons, flourishing livestock, wind and rain at the right time year in and year out, and rain and wind year out and year in at the right time.&rdquo; The people al kowtowed in thanks.</p>
<p>What could then be seen were a countless number of people lined up behind each other to offer fruit and other vegetarian food. &ldquo;I&rsquo;l be blowed,&rdquo; said Pig with a laugh. &ldquo;In the old days, when I could eat, nobody ever asked me to do so ten times over. But now, when I can&rsquo;t, one family won&rsquo;t wait for another to finish before offering me food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1575</p>
<p>Although he was feeling ful he did get going a lit le and ate eight or nine meatless dishes; and despite having an injured stomach he also downed twenty or thirty steamed breadrol s. When they were al ful , more people came with further invitations. &ldquo;Grateful though I am for your great affection,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanzang said, &ldquo;I do not deserve it. I hope that we may be al owed to rest tonight. Tomorrow morning we wil accept some more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was now late at night. Sanzang, who was guarding the true scriptures and would not leave them for a moment, sat in meditation at the foot of the tower to keep a vigil. As the third watch of the night approached he said quietly,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wukong, the people here know that we have found the Way and completed our undertaking. As the old saying goes, &lsquo;The true adept does not show his face; who shows his face is no true adept.&lsquo;I am afraid that if we tarry too long here that we may fail in our main enterprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say is right, Master,&rdquo; Monkey replied. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s slip quietly away in the middle of the night while they&rsquo;re al sound asleep.&rdquo; Pig too understood, Friar Sand comprehended very clearly, and the white horse also knew what he meant. So they got up, quietly loaded the packs, shouldered the poles, and carried the things out along the cloister. When they reached the main gates and found them locked Monkey used unlocking magic to open the inner gates and the main gates. They fol owed the path East, only to hear the Eight Vajrapanis cal ing from mid-air. &ldquo;Come with us, escapers.&rdquo; The venerable elder then smelt incense as he rose up into the air. This was indeed a case of: When the elixir is formed one sees the original face; When the body is strong one can then visit one&rsquo;s sovereign.</p>
<p>If you do not know how he saw the Tang emperor, listen to the explanation in the next instal ment.</p>
