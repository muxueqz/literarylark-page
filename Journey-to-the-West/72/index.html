<p><em>Under a False Name Monkey Beats the Demon Hound</em> <em>Guanyin Appears to Subdue the Demon King</em></p>
<p>Mat er has always been empty;</p>
<p>Emptiness said to be mat er is only natural.</p>
<p>When one penetrates the dhyana of mat er&rsquo;s emptiness There is no need for cinnabar to be refined into elixir.</p>
<p>Rest not when pursuing perfection of virtue and conduct; Endure suffering to achieve hard-won skil s.</p>
<p>Sometimes one only turns to heaven when one&rsquo;s actions are complete, To win an unchanging and immortal face.</p>
<p>The story tel s how the Evil Star Matcher had the front and back gates tightly closed while Monkey was hunted for. The din went on til dusk, but no sign of him did they find. The demon king sat in the Flaying Pavilion, where he cal ed his demons together and issued orders to the guards on al the gates to carry bel s, shout passwords, beat drums and strike clappers. Everyone was to have an arrow on his bowstring or a sword unsheathed as he took his turn 1111</p>
<p>to keep watch during the night. Sun Wukong, who had turned into a fly, was sit ing by the gates. Seeing how strict the security was at the front gates he spread his wings and flew to the gateway of the living quarters to take a look.</p>
<p>He saw the Golden Queen slumped across a low table, the tears flowing down as she wept quietly in her sorrow, so he flew inside and landed lightly on the loose black clouds of her hair to listen to what she was crying about.</p>
<p>A moment later she said tearful y, &ldquo;My lord, you and I, Burnt in an earlier life the incense of separation, And now I have encountered an evil demon king.</p>
<p>For three years I have been gone: when wil we two be reunited?</p>
<p>Great is the grief of mandarin ducks that are parted.</p>
<p>Just when the priest had brought me your message Our union has been severed once more and the monkey is dead.</p>
<p>Because he was too curious about the golden bel s I long for you now more desperately than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he heard this Monkey went behind her ear, where he whispered,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Your Majesty. I&rsquo;m the holy monk, the venerable Sun Wukong, who was sent from your country. I&rsquo;m stil alive. It was al because I was too impatient. I went to your dressing table and stole the golden bel s.</p>
<p>While you were drinking with the demon king I sneaked out to the pavilion in the front, but I couldn&rsquo;t restrain myself from opening them up to take a look at them. I didn&rsquo;t mean to, but I tore the cot on wool muffling the bel s, and the moment they rang flame, smoke and sand came gushing out. I panicked, threw the bel s down, turned back into myself, and tried hard to fight my way out with my iron cudgel. When I failed and was scared they&rsquo;d kil me I turned into a fly, and hid on the door pivot til just now. The demon king has made the security precautions even stricter and he won&rsquo;t open the doors. Wil you act like a wife to him and lure him in here to sleep so that I can escape and find some other way of rescuing you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the queen heard this she shivered and shook, and her hair stood on end as if a spirit were pul ing it; she was terrified, as if her heart was being pounded by a pestle. &ldquo;Are you a man or a ghost?&rdquo; she asked, the tears streaming down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither man nor ghost,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;At the moment I&rsquo;ve turned into a fly and I&rsquo;m here. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. Hurry up and ask the demon king here.&rdquo; The queen stil refused to believe him.</p>
<p>1112</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop appearing in this nightmare,&rdquo; she said in a low voice through her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in a nightmare,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t believe me put your hand out and open it. I&rsquo;l jump down into it for you to see.&rdquo; The queen then put out her open hand. Monkey flew down and landed lightly on her jade palm. He was just like</p>
<p>A black bean on a lotus flower,</p>
<p>A bee resting on a peony blossom,</p>
<p>A raisin fal en into a hydrangea,</p>
<p>A black spot on a wild lily stalk.</p>
<p>The queen raised her hand and said, &ldquo;Holy monk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the holy monk transformed,&rdquo; Monkey replied. Only then did the queen believe him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I invite the demon king here what are you going to do?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an old saying that there&rsquo;s nothing like liquor for ending a life,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey replied, &ldquo;and another that there&rsquo;s nothing like liquor for solving any problem. Liquor&rsquo;s very useful stuff. The best thing is to give him plenty to drink. Cal one of your personal slave-girls in and let me have a look at her so I can make myself look like her and wait on you. Then I&rsquo;l be able to make my move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The queen did as he told her. &ldquo;Spring Beauty, where are you?&rdquo; she cal ed, and a fox with a beautiful face came in round the screen, knelt down and said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What orders did Your Majesty cal me in to receive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tel them to come in and light the silk lanterns, burn some musk, and help me into the front room,&rdquo; the queen said. &ldquo;Then I shal ask His Majesty to bed.&rdquo; Spring Beauty went to the front and cal ed seven or eight deer and fox spirits who lined up on either side of her. They carried two pairs of lanterns and one pair of portable incense-burners. By the time the queen bowed to them with her hands together the Great Sage had already flown off.</p>
<p>Spreading his wings, the splendid Monkey flew straight to the top of Spring Beauty&rsquo;s head, where he pul ed out one of his hairs, blew a magic breath on it, and cal ed, &ldquo;Change!&rdquo; It turned into a sleep insect that landed lightly on Spring Beauty&rsquo;s face. Now when sleep insects reach a human face they crawl into the nostrils, and once they are inside the person goes to sleep. Spring Beauty did indeed start feeling sleepy. She could not keep on her feet, but swayed about and felt dozy as she hurried to where she had been resting before, col apsed head first and fel into a deep sleep. Brother Monkey then 1113</p>
<p>jumped down, shook himself, turned into Spring Beauty&rsquo;s exact likeness and went back round the screen to line up with the others.</p>
<p>As the Golden Queen walked into the front part of the palace a lit le devil saw her and reported to the Evil Star Matcher, &ldquo;The queen&rsquo;s here, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demon king hurried out of the Flaying Pavilion to greet her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; the queen said, &ldquo;the smoke and fire have been put out and there&rsquo;s no sign of the thief. As it&rsquo;s late now I&rsquo;ve come to urge you to come to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How considerate you are, my queen,&rdquo; the monster replied ut erly delighted to see her. &ldquo;The thief was Sun Wukong who defeated my vanguard warrior, then kil ed my lieutenant and came here disguised as him to fool us. We&rsquo;ve searched but can&rsquo;t find a trace of him. It makes me feel uneasy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wretch must have got away,&rdquo; the queen replied. &ldquo;Relax, Your Majesty, stop worrying, and come to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing the queen standing there and inviting him so earnestly the demon king could not refuse too insistently, so he told the other demons to be careful with the fires and lamps and be on their guard against robbers before he went to the living quarters at the back with the queen. Monkey, disguised as Spring Beauty, led their way with the other slave girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring wine for His Majesty,&rdquo; the queen said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s exhausted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I am,&rdquo; said the demon king with a smile, &ldquo;indeed I am. Fetch some at once. It&rsquo;l calm our nerves.&rdquo; The imitation Spring Beauty and the other servants then laid out fruit and high meat and set a table and chairs. The queen raised a cup and the demon king did likewise; each gave the other a drink from their own.</p>
<p>The imitation Spring Beauty, who was standing beside them, said as she held the jug, &ldquo;As tonight is the first time Your Majesties have given each other a drink from your own cups I hope that you wil each drain them dry for double happiness.&rdquo; They did indeed both refil their cups and drain them again. &ldquo;As this is so happy an occasion for Your Majesties why don&rsquo;t we slave girls sing and dance for you?&rdquo; the imitation Spring Beauty suggested.</p>
<p>Before the words were al out of her mouth melodious voices could be heard as the singing and dancing began. The two of them drank a lot more before the queen cal ed for the singing and dancing to end. The slave girls divided themselves into their groups and went to line up outside the screen, leaving only the imitation Spring Beauty to hold the jug and serve them wine. The 1114</p>
<p>queen and the demon king spoke to each other like husband and wife, and the queen was so ful of sensuality that the demon king&rsquo;s bones turned soft and his sinews went numb. The only trouble was that the poor demon was not lucky enough to enjoy her favours. Indeed, it was a case of &ldquo;happiness over nothing, like a cat biting a piss bubble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After talking and laughing for a while the queen asked, &ldquo;Were the treasures damaged, Your Majesty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those are treasures that were cast long, long ago,&rdquo; the demon king said, &ldquo;so they couldn&rsquo;t possibly be damaged. Al that happened was that the thief tore the cot on wool that was muffling the bel s and the leopard skin wrapper was burnt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have they been put away?&rdquo; the queen asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need for that,&rdquo; the demon king replied. &ldquo;I carry them at my waist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hearing this, the imitation Spring Beauty pul ed out a handful of his hairs, chewed them up into lit le bits, crept closer to the demon king, put the pieces of hair on the demon&rsquo;s body, blew three magic breaths, said &ldquo;Change!&rdquo; very quietly, and turned the pieces of hair into three revolting pests: lice, fleas and bedbugs. They al made for the demon king&rsquo;s body and started biting his skin wildly. Itching unbearably, the demon king put his hands inside his clothing to rub the irritation. He caught a few of the lice between his fingers and took them to a lamp for a closer look.</p>
<p>When the queen saw them she said mockingly, &ldquo;Your Majesty, your shirt must be filthy. It can&rsquo;t have been washed for ages. I expect that&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never had insects like these before,&rdquo; he said in embarrassment. &ldquo;I would have to make a fool of myself tonight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, making a fool of yourself, Your Majesty?&rdquo; the queen said with a smile. &ldquo;As the saying goes, even the emperor has three imperial lice. Undress and I&rsquo;l catch them for you.&rdquo; The demon king real y did undo his belt and take his clothes off.</p>
<p>The imitation Spring Beauty was standing beside the demon king looking closely at the fleas leaping around between each layer of clothing, on which were rows of enormous bedbugs. Lice and nits were crowded as closely together as ants coming out of their nest. When the demon king took off the third layer of clothing and revealed his flesh the golden bel s were also swarming with countless insects.</p>
<p>1115</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; said the imitation Spring Beauty, &ldquo;hand me the bel s so that I can catch the lice on them for you.&rdquo; The demon king was so overcome with shame and alarm that he handed the three bel s to Spring Beauty, not noticing that she was an impostor.</p>
<p>The imitation Spring Beauty took the bel s and made a long show of catching lice. When she saw the demon king looking down to shake his clothes she hid the golden bel s, pul ed out a hair and turned it into three more bel s just like the originals that she carried to the lamp to examine.</p>
<p>She then wriggled, braced herself, put the lice, bedbugs and fleas back on her body and returned the imitation bel s to the monster. He took them but was stil too befuddled to see that they were copies. Passing them with both his hands to the queen he said, &ldquo;Put them away now, but be very careful with them, not like before.&rdquo; The queen took the bel s, quietly opened the chest, put them inside, and locked them in with a golden lock. Then she drank several more cups of wine with the demon king.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dust and clean the ivory bed,&rdquo; she ordered the serving women, &ldquo;and spread the brocade quilt. His Majesty and I are going to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demon king expressed his thanks but said, &ldquo;I have no such luck. I don&rsquo;t dare go with you. I&rsquo;l take one of the palace women with me and go to bed in the Western part of the palace. I wish you a good night by yourself, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; With that each of them went to bed, and we wil say no more of that.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the successful imitation Spring Beauty tucked the treasures into her belt and turned back into Monkey. He shook himself, took back the sleep insect, and headed for the front of the palace, where nightsticks and bel s sounded together to mark the third watch. Splendid Monkey made himself invisible by making a spel with his hands and saying the words of it. Going straight to the gates he saw that they were very firmly locked and bolted, so he brought out his gold-banded cudgel, pointed it at the door and made unlocking magic. The gates swung easily open.</p>
<p>Hurrying outside he stood by the gates and shouted two or three times at the top of his voice, &ldquo;Evil Star Matcher, give us back our Golden Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This startled al the devils, who hurried to look and saw that the gates were open. Quickly they fetched lamps to find the locks and fasten the gates once more. Several of them were sent running back inside to report, &ldquo;Your Majesty, there&rsquo;s someone outside the main gates shouting your title and 1116</p>
<p>demanding the Golden Queen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The slave girls hurried out to say very quietly, &ldquo;Stop yel ing. His Majesty&rsquo;s only just gone to sleep.&rdquo; Monkey gave another loud shout at the front gates, but the lit le devils stil dared not disturb their master. This happened three or four times over, but they never went in to report. The Great Sage kept up his din til daybreak, by when his patience was exhausted and he swung his iron cudgel to hit the gates. This so alarmed the demons big and smal that while some of them barricaded the gates the others went in to report.</p>
<p>As soon as the demon king woke up and heard the cacophonous din he got up, dressed and emerged from his bed-curtains to ask, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s al the shouting about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the kneeling slave girls, &ldquo;someone&rsquo;s been shouting and cursing outside the cave half the night. We don&rsquo;t know who it is. Now he&rsquo;s at acking the gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the demon king went out through the gates of the palace several panic-stricken lit le devils appeared to kowtow to him and say, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s someone shouting and cursing outside. He&rsquo;s demanding the Golden Queen, and if we say so much as half a &rsquo;no&rsquo;he goes on and on at us, swearing in a thoroughly horrible way. When Your Majesty stil hadn&rsquo;t come out at daybreak he got so desperate he started at acking the gates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t open them,&rdquo; the demon king said. &ldquo;Go and ask him where he&rsquo;s from and what he&rsquo;s cal ed. Report back as quickly as you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lit le devils hurried off to ask through the gates, &ldquo;Who are you, knocking at our gates?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your grandpa sent by Purpuria to take the Golden Queen back to her own country,&rdquo; Monkey replied. When the lit le devils heard this they reported it to the demon king, who went back to the living quarters at the back to question the queen about why the at acker had come.</p>
<p>The queen had only just arisen and had not yet done her hair or washed when slave girls came in to report, &ldquo;His Majesty&rsquo;s here.&rdquo; The queen hastily tidied up her clothes and let her black tresses hang loose as she went outside to greet him.</p>
<p>He had just sat down and had not yet asked her any questions when lit le demons were heard again asking, &ldquo;The Grand Par from over there has smashed the gates down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many officers are there in your country, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; The demon king 1117</p>
<p>asked with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inside the palace there are forty-eight brigades of horse and foot, and a thousand good officers; and there are ever so many marshals and commanders on the frontiers,&rdquo; the queen replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are any cal ed Grand Par?&rdquo; the demon king asked. &ldquo;When I was in the palace al I knew about was helping His Majesty in the inner quarters and instructing the consorts and concubines every morning and evening,&rdquo; the queen said. &ldquo;There were no end of things happening outside. How could I possibly remember the names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This one cal s himself Grand Par,&rdquo; the demon king replied. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no such name I can think of in the book The Hundred Surnames. You&rsquo;re a very intel igent and wel -born lady, ma&rsquo;am, and you&rsquo;ve lived in a royal palace.</p>
<p>You must have read a lot of books. Can you remember coming across that name in any of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a passage in the Thousand Word Classic that goes, &lsquo;received grand instruction,&rsquo;&rdquo; the queen replied. &ldquo;I think that must refer to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; the demon king said with pleasure, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo; He then got up, took his leave of the queen, went to the Flaying Pavilion, fastened his armor on neatly, mustered his devil soldiers, had the gates opened, and went straight outside with his flower-scat ering bat le-axe in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the Grand Par from Purpuria?&rdquo; he yel ed stridently at the top of his voice.</p>
<p>Grasping his gold-banded cudgel in his right hand and pointing with his left Monkey replied, &ldquo;What are you shouting at me for, nephew?&rdquo; The sight of him drove the demon king into a fury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn you,&rdquo; he shouted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a face just like a monkey&rsquo;s;</p>
<p>You resemble a macaque.</p>
<p>A ghost is what you look like;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to knock me back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impudent devil,&rdquo; laughed Monkey, &ldquo;trying to bul y your superiors and push your master around. You&rsquo;re blind. I remember how when I made havoc in Heaven five hundred years ago al the nine heavenly generals only dared speak to me with the greatest respect. If I make you cal me Grandpa I&rsquo;m let ing you off lightly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1118</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tel me your name immediately,&rdquo; the demon king shouted. &ldquo;What fighting skil s have you got that give you the nerve to come rampaging here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have done bet er not to ask me what I&rsquo;m cal ed,&rdquo; Monkey replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as you insist on me tel ing you I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;l be in a hopeless mess.</p>
<p>Come here and stand stil while I tel you:</p>
<p>Heaven and earth were the parents that bore me; My foetus was formed from the sun and moon&rsquo;s essence.</p>
<p>The magic rock was pregnant for years beyond number; Strange indeed was the miraculous root&rsquo;s gestation.</p>
<p>When I was born the Three Positives were at their height; Now I have been converted al is in harmony.</p>
<p>Once I was declared the chief of al the demons, Who bowed to me by the red cliff as subduer of monsters.</p>
<p>The Jade Emperor issued a decree of summons,</p>
<p>And the Great White Planet came with the edict, Inviting me to Heaven to take up my office,</p>
<p>But as Protector of the Horses I had no joy.</p>
<p>When I first planned rebel ion in my mountain cave Boldly I led my armies against the Jade Emperor, The Pagoda-carrying Heavenly King and Prince Nezha Were ut erly helpless when they fought against me.</p>
<p>Then the White Planes made a new suggestion,</p>
<p>And brought another edict urging me to make peace I was made Great Sage Equaling Heaven,</p>
<p>And proclaimed as one of the pil ars of the state.</p>
<p>Because I disrupted the banquet of peaches</p>
<p>And stole elixir when drunk I met with disaster.</p>
<p>Lord Lao Zi submit ed a memorial in person,</p>
<p>And the Queen Mother of the West did homage to the throne.</p>
<p>Knowing that I was running riot with the law, They mustered heavenly forces and issued movement orders.</p>
<p>A hundred thousand vicious stars and evil planets Were packed in close array with their swords and their halberds.</p>
<p>Heaven-and-earth nets were spread across the mountain As al of the soldiers raised their weapons together.</p>
<p>A bout of bit er fighting left neither side the victor, 1119</p>
<p>So Guanyin recommended the warrior Erlang.</p>
<p>The two of us fought together for mastery;</p>
<p>He was helped by the Seven Brothers who come from Plum Hil .</p>
<p>Each of us played the hero and did our transformations: The three sages at the gates of Heaven opened the clouds.</p>
<p>Then Lord Lao Zi dropped his diamond noose,</p>
<p>And the gods led me as a prisoner to the steps of the throne-hal .</p>
<p>They did not bother with a detailed indictment: The sentence was death by a thousand cuts.</p>
<p>Axe and hammer could not til me,</p>
<p>And I was unharmed by sword or saber.</p>
<p>Fire and thunderbolts were neither here nor there; They had no way to destroy my immortal body.</p>
<p>I was taken under escort to the Tushita Heaven, And al was arranged to refine me in the furnace.</p>
<p>Only when ful time was up did they open up the vessel, And I came bounding out from the middle of the crucible.</p>
<p>In my hands I was wielding this As-You-Wil cudgel As I somersaulted up to the Jade Emperor&rsquo;s throne.</p>
<p>Al the stars and constel ations went into hiding, And I could play the vandal in the palaces of Heaven.</p>
<p>The Miraculous Investigator rushed to invite the Buddha, Then Sakyamuni and I both displayed our powers.</p>
<p>Turning my somersaults in the palm of his hand I roamed al over the heavens before my return.</p>
<p>The Buddha then, using both foresight and deception, Crushed and held me at the ends of the heavens.</p>
<p>After a period of over five hundred years</p>
<p>My body was delivered and I could once more play up.</p>
<p>Guarding the Tang Priest on his journey to the West, Brother Sun Wukong is very intel igent.</p>
<p>I subdue the demons on the Westward road:</p>
<p>Every evil spirit is struck with terror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the demon king heard him tel that he was Sun Wukong he said, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the so-and-so who made havoc in Heaven. If you were released to guard the Tang Priest on his journey West then you should be an your way 1120</p>
<p>there. Why are you being such a busybody and making trouble for me?</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re acting as if you were the slave of Purpuria. By coming here you&rsquo;ve thrown your life away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thieving damned monster,&rdquo; Monkey shouted back. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about. I was politely invited to help by the king of Purpuria.</p>
<p>He addressed me very respectful y and treated me wel . I&rsquo;m a thousand times higher than that king. He treated me as if I were his father and mother or a god. How can you say I&rsquo;m acting like a slave? I&rsquo;l get you, you monster, for bul ying your superiors and trying to push your master around. Stay there and take this from your grandpa.&rdquo; The monster then moved his hands and feet as fast as he could, dodged the blow from the cudgel and struck back at Brother Monkey&rsquo;s face with his flower-scat ering axe. It was a fine bat le.</p>
<p>Just watch!</p>
<p>The gold-banded As-You-Wil cudgel,</p>
<p>The flower-scat ering axe and its wind-keen blade.</p>
<p>One ground his teeth with terrible ferocity;</p>
<p>The other gnashed his molars and displayed his might.</p>
<p>One was the Great Sage Equaling Heaven descended to earth, The other an evil demon king come down to the lower world.</p>
<p>Both snorted out clouds and shining mists that lit up the heavenly palace.</p>
<p>Sent stones and sand flying that blot ed out the Dipper.</p>
<p>They came and went through many a movement,</p>
<p>Twisting and turning and giving off golden light.</p>
<p>Each used al of his talents to the ful ;</p>
<p>Both staked the whole of their magical powers.</p>
<p>One wanted to take the queen back to the capital; The other would happily have stayed with her in the cave.</p>
<p>There was no deep reason for the struggle:</p>
<p>He was ready to give his life for the sake of the king.</p>
<p>When the two of them had fought fifty rounds without result the demon king realized that Monkey was too strong a fighter for him to be able to beat.</p>
<p>Blocking the iron cudgel with his axe the demon said, &ldquo;Stop, Sun the Novice.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t had my breakfast yet today. Let me eat, then I&rsquo;l have it out with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey was wel aware that he wanted to fetch the bel s, so he put his cudgel away and said, &ldquo;A hero doesn&rsquo;t chase an exhausted hare. Off you go. Have 1121</p>
<p>a good meal, and get ready to come back and die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The demon quickly turned and rushed inside, where he said to the queen,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get me my treasures at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man chal enging me to bat le this morning was a disciple of the monk who&rsquo;s going to fetch the scriptures,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s cal ed Sun Wukong, or Sun the Novice, and Grand Par was just a nickname. I&rsquo;ve been bat ling it out with him al this time, but stil there&rsquo;s no outcome. Just wait while I take my treasures out and set off smoke and flames to burn that ape.&rdquo; These words made the queen feel very uneasy. If she didn&rsquo;t fetch the bel s, she was worried that he might be suspicious, but if she did she feared that Sun the Novice would be kil ed. As she was hesitating the demon king pressed her again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry up and fetch them.&rdquo; She had no choice but to undo the lock, bring out the three bel s and hand them to the demon king, who took them and went outside the cave again. The queen sat in the inner quarters, her tears pouring down like rain, as she thought that Monkey would not possibly be able to escape with his life. Neither of them realized that the bel s were only copies.</p>
<p>Once outside the cave the demon stood upwind and shouted, &ldquo;Stay where you are, Sun the Novice. Watch while I ring these bel s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have your bel s, but why shouldn&rsquo;t I have mine?&rdquo; Monkey replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can ring yours, so why shouldn&rsquo;t I ring mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bel s have you got?&rdquo; the demon king asked. &ldquo;Show me.&rdquo; Monkey pinched his iron cudgel to make it into an embroidery needle that he tucked into his ear then brought out the three real treasures from at his waist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are my purple gold bel s,&rdquo; he said to the demon king. The sight of them came as a shock to the demon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;very funny. Why are his bel s exactly the same as mine? Even if they&rsquo;d been cast from the same mould they&rsquo;d not have been properly smoothed: you&rsquo;d expect some extra marks or missing knobs. How can they be identical with this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get your bel s from?&rdquo; he went on to ask again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are yours from, dear nephew?&rdquo; Monkey replied.</p>
<p>Being honest, the demon king replied, &ldquo;These bel s of mine, Come from deep in the Way of the Immortal of Great Purity, Are made of gold long refined in the Eight Trigrams Furnace Formed into bel s renowned as ultimate treasures 1122</p>
<p>Left by Lord Lao Zi til the present day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where my bel s come from too,&rdquo; Monkey replied with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were they made?&rdquo; the demon king asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These bel s of mine,&rdquo; said Monkey,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were made of gold refined in the furnace</p>
<p>When Lord Lao Zi made elixir in the Tushita Palace.</p>
<p>They are cyclical treasures.</p>
<p>The two threes make six:</p>
<p>Mine are the female and yours are the male.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bel s are golden elixir treasures,&rdquo; the demon king said, &ldquo;not birds or beasts. They can&rsquo;t be male or female. As long as they yield what&rsquo;s precious when they&rsquo;re rung they&rsquo;re good ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Words prove nothing,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;Show it by actions. Shake yours first.&rdquo; The demon king then rang his first bel three times. No fire came out.</p>
<p>He rang his second three times. No smoke came out. He rang his third three times, and no sand came out either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very odd,&rdquo; he said, making wild gestures, &ldquo;very odd. The world&rsquo;s changed.</p>
<p>These bel s must be hen-pecked. When the males see the females they don&rsquo;t dare to do their stuff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, nephew,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to shake mine to show you what happens.&rdquo; The splendid ape then grasped al three bel s in one hand and rang them together. Watch as clouds of red flames, black smoke and yel ow sand al come gushing out, set ing the trees and the mountain ablaze. Monkey then said the words of another spel and shouted &ldquo;Wind!&rdquo; towards the Southeast; and a wind did indeed spring up that fanned the flames. With the power of the wind behind them the flames and smoke fil ed the heavens, blazing red and deepest black, and the earth was covered by the yel ow sandstorm. The Evil Star Matcher&rsquo;s souls fled from his body in his terror, but he had nowhere to turn: amid that fire there was no way of escaping with his life.</p>
<p>Then a penetrating shout was heard from mid-air: &ldquo;Sun Wukong, I am here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey quickly looked up and saw that it was the Bodhisat va Guanyin holding her vase of pure water in her left hand and a sprig of wil ow in her right with which to sprinkle sweet dew and put out the flames. In his alarm Monkey hid the bel s at his waist, put the palms of his hands together and prostrated himself in a kowtow. The Bodhisat va flicked a few drops of sweet 1123</p>
<p>dew from her wil ow sprig and in an instant both flames and smoke disappeared, while no sign of the yel ow sand remained to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not realize, Most Merciful One, that you were coming down to the mortal world,&rdquo; said Brother Monkey as he kowtowed, &ldquo;and it was wrong of me to fail to keep out of your way. May I venture to ask where you are going, Bodhisat va?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am here especial y to find and take this evil monster,&rdquo; the Bodhisat va replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the monster&rsquo;s background, and how can he put you to the trouble of capturing him in your il ustrious person?&rdquo; Monkey asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a golden-haired giant hound on which I used to ride,&rdquo; the Bodhisat va replied. &ldquo;The boy in charge of it fel asleep and failed to keep proper guard over it, so that the wicked beast bit through its iron chains and escaped to save the king of Purpuria from disaster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Monkey heard this he hastily bowed and said, &ldquo;You have it the wrong way round, Bodhisat va. He&rsquo;s been mistreating the king and his queen, and thus damaging public morality. So how can you say that he has saved the king from disaster when in fact he has brought him disaster?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not know,&rdquo; the Bodhisat va replied, &ldquo;that when the previous king of Purpuria was reigning and the present king was the crown prince and had not yet taken the throne he was a superb archer and huntsman. Once he led his men and horses hunting with falcon and hound. They came to the Fal en Phoenix Slope, where a young peacock and peahen, two children of the Buddha&rsquo;s mother in the West, the Bodhisat va Maurya Vidya Rani were resting. When the king shot with his bow he wounded the cock, while the hen died with an arrow stil in her. After the Buddha&rsquo;s mother realized to her regret what had happened she ordered that the prince should be separated from his wife for three years and suffer himself the way birds do when they are parted from their mates. At the time I was riding that hound and we both heard her say that. I never imagined that the beast would remember it and come back to mistreat the queen and thus save the king from disaster. That was three years ago, and now that the misdeed has been paid for it was fortunate that you came along to cure the king. I am here to recover the wicked and evil creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bodhisat va,&rdquo; said Monkey, &ldquo;this may wel be so, but he did sul y the queen, damage public morality, offend ethics and break the law. You can&rsquo;t let him 1124</p>
<p>off a non-capital punishment. Let me give him twenty blows before handing him over for you to take back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wukong,&rdquo; said the Bodhisat va, &ldquo;as you know I am here you real y ought to show me the respect I deserve and spare him completely. This stil counts as one of your successes in subduing a demon. If you hit him with your cudgel it&rsquo;l kil him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Monkey dared not disobey, but bowed and said, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re taking him back to the ocean with you, Bodhisat va, you mustn&rsquo;t let him escape and come down to the human world again. That would be quite a catastrophe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only then did the Bodhisat va shout, &ldquo;Wicked beast! Turn back into your own form! What are you waiting for?&rdquo; The monster could be seen doing a rol and turning back into himself. Then he shook his fur for the Bodhisat va to mount on his back. The Bodhisat va looked down at his neck to see that the three golden bel s were missing. &ldquo;Wukong,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;give me my bel s back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where they are,&rdquo; Monkey said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thieving ape,&rdquo; the Bodhisat va shouted. &ldquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t stolen those bel s then ten Sun Wukongs, never mind one, would have dared go nowhere near him. Hand them over at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I real y haven&rsquo;t seen them,&rdquo; Monkey replied with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I&rsquo;l have to recite the Band-tightening Spel ,&rdquo; said the Bodhisat va.</p>
<p>This scared Monkey, who could only plead, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say it, don&rsquo;t say it. The bel s are here.&rdquo; This was indeed a case of</p>
<p>Who could untie the bel s from neck of the giant hound?</p>
<p>To find that out ask the one who first fastened them on.</p>
<p>The Bodhisat va then placed the bel s round the giant hound&rsquo;s neck, and flew up to her high throne. Watch as the</p>
<p>Four-stalked lotus flowers blazed with fire;</p>
<p>Her whole body was thickly clad in cloth of gold.</p>
<p>We wil say no more of how the Great Merciful One returned to the Southern Ocean.</p>
<p>The Great Sage Sun Wukong then tidied up his clothing and charged into the Horndog Gave swinging his iron cudgel and kil ing to his heart&rsquo;s content.</p>
<p>He wiped al the demons out til he reached the inner quarters of the palace and asked the Golden Queen to go back to her country. She prostrated herself 1125</p>
<p>to him for a long time. Monkey told her al about how the Bodhisat va had subdued the demon and why she had been separated from her husband. Then he gathered some soft grasses that he twisted together into a long straw dragon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit on this, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and shut your eyes. Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I&rsquo;m taking you back to court to see your master.&rdquo; The queen fol owed his instructions careful y while he used his magic power. There was a sound of the wind whistling in her ears.</p>
<p>An hour later he brought her into the city. Bringing his cloud down he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open your eyes, ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo; When the queen opened her eyes and looked she recognized the phoenix buildings and dragon towers. She was very happy, and get ing off the straw dragon she climbed the steps of the throne hal .</p>
<p>When the king saw her he came straight down from his dragon throne to take the queen by her jade hand.</p>
<p>He was just going to tel her how much he had missed her when he suddenly col apsed, shouting: &ldquo;My hand hurts, my hand hurts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that mug,&rdquo; Pig said, roaring with laughter, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s out of luck. No joy for him. The moment he meets her again he gets stung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Idiot,&rdquo; said Monkey, &ldquo;would you dare grab her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if I did?&rdquo; Pig asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The queen&rsquo;s covered with poisonous spikes,&rdquo; Monkey replied, &ldquo;and she has poison on her hands. In the three years she was with the Evil Star Matcher in Mount Unicorn the monster never had her. If he had, his whole body would have been in agony. Even touching her with his hand made his hand ache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what is to be done about it?&rdquo; the officials asked. While al the officials were wondering what to do in the outer palace and the consorts and concubines in the inner palace were ful of terror, the Jade and the Silver Queen helped their king to his feet.</p>
<p>Amid-the general alarm a voice was heard in the sky shouting, &ldquo;Great Sage, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; Brother Monkey looked up, and this is what was to be seen: The cry of a crane soaring through the heavens, Then flying straight down to the palace of the king.</p>
<p>Beams of auspicious light shone about;</p>
<p>Clouds of holy vapors drifted al around.</p>
<p>Mists came from the cloak of coconut that covered his body: Rare were the straw sandals on which he trod.</p>
<p>1126</p>
<p>The fly-whisk in his hand was made of dragon whiskers, And silken tassels hung around his waist.</p>
<p>He joined human destinies together throughout heaven and earth As he roamed free and easy al over the world.</p>
<p>He was the Purple Clouds Immortal of the Daluo Heaven, Come down to earth today to lift an enchantment.</p>
<p>Monkey went over to him to greet him with, &ldquo;Where are you going, Zhang Boduan of the Ziyang sect?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The True Man of Ziyang came to the front of the hal , bowed and replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Sage, the humble immortal Zhang Boduan greets you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo; Monkey replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three years ago I passed this way when going to a Buddha assembly,&rdquo; the True Man said. &ldquo;When I saw that the King of Purpuria was suffering the agony of being parted from his wife I was worried that the demon would defile the queen. That would have been an affront to morality and made it hard for the queen to be reunited with the king later on. So I turned an old coconut cloak into a new dress of many colours and gave it to the demon king. He made the queen wear it as her wedding dress. As soon as she put it on poisonous barbs grew al over her body. They were the coconut cloak.</p>
<p>Now that you have been successful, Great Sage, I&rsquo;ve come to lift the spel .&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said Monkey, &ldquo;thank you for coming so far. Please remove the barbs at once.&rdquo; The True Man stepped forward, pointed at the queen, and removed the coconut cloak. The queen&rsquo;s body was once more as it had original y been.</p>
<p>The True Man shook the cloak, put it over his shoulders, and said to Monkey,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please forgive me if I leave now, Great Sage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet,&rdquo; said Monkey. &ldquo;Wait til the king has thanked you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t trouble him,&rdquo; said the True Man with a smile, then raised his hands together in salute, rose up into the sky and went. The king, queen and the officials high and low were so astonished that they al bowed to the sky.</p>
<p>When the bowing was over the king ordered that the Eastern hal of the palace be thrown open so that they could give thanks to the four monks. The king led al his officials to go down on their knees and kowtow to them, and husband and wife were reunited. In the middle of the celebratory banquet Monkey said, &ldquo;Master, bring out that declaration of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The venerable elder produced it from his sleeve and handed it to Monkey, 1127</p>
<p>who passed it in turn to the king. &ldquo;This was a let er that the demons sent his lieutenant to deliver,&rdquo; Monkey said. &ldquo;He was the officer I kil ed and brought here as a trophy. Then I turned myself into the officer and went back to the cave to report. That was how I saw Her Majesty and stole the golden bel s.</p>
<p>He almost caught me, but I did another change, stole them again, got them out and fought him. It was lucky for him that the Bodhisat va Guanyin came to col ect him and tel me why you and Her Majesty were parted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told the whole story from beginning to end in great detail. Everyone in the country&mdash;whether ruler or ministers, whether within the palace or outside&mdash;expressed admiration and gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said the Tang Priest, &ldquo;it was because of Your Majesty&rsquo;s own good fortune, and in the second place it was thanks to my disciple&rsquo;s efforts. We are deeply obliged to you for this sumptuous banquet today, and now we must take our leave of you. Please do not delay us poor monks on our pilgrimage to the West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the king realized that his efforts to keep them there would be of no avail he inspected and returned the passport and arranged a great procession of royal coaches. The Tang Priest was invited to sit in his own dragon carriage, while the king, his queens and his consorts themselves al pushed it along as they saw them on their way then bade them farewel . Indeed: He was fated to have his melancholy washed clean away: The mind finds peace of itself when thought and worrying cease.</p>
<p>If you do not know what of good or il lay in store for them on the way ahead listen to the explanation in the next instal ment.</p>
