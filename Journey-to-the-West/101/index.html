<p><em>The Journey Back to the East Is Made</em></p>
<p><em>The Five Immortals Achieve Nirvana</em></p>
<p>We wil tel not of how the four travelers escaped and rose on the wind with the vajrapanis, but of the many people in the Temple of Deliverance in Chen Vil age. After they rose at dawn to prepare more fruit and delicacies to offer they came to the ground floor of the tower and found the Tang Priest gone.</p>
<p>Some asked questions and others searched. They were al thrown into panic 1576</p>
<p>and did not know what to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve let those living Buddhas al get clean away,&rdquo; they lamented as their howls rose to the skies.As there was nothing else they could do about it they carried al the food they had prepared to the ground floor of the tower as offerings and burned imitation paper money. From then on four major sacrifices and twenty-four minor sacrifices were held every year. In addition people praying for cures or safety, seeking marriages, making vows, and seeking wealth or sons came at every hour of every day to bum incense and make offerings. Indeed:</p>
<p>Incense smoked in the golden burner for a thousand years; The light burned in the lamps of jade through eternity.</p>
<p>We wil say no more of this, but tel of how the Eight Vajrapanis used a second fragrant wind to carry the four pilgrims off again. Some days later they reached the East, and Chang&rsquo;an came gradual y into view. Now after seeing the Tang Priest off from the city on the twelfth day of the ninth month in the thirteenth year of Then Guan the Emperor Taizong had in the sixteenth year sent officials of his Department of Works to build a Watching For the Scriptures Tower outside the city of Chang&rsquo;an to receive the scriptures. Here Taizong went in person every year. It so happened that on the very day the emperor went to the tower the Western sky was fil ed with auspicious light and gusts of scented wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy monk,&rdquo; the vajrapanis said, stopping in mid air, &ldquo;this is the city of Chang&rsquo;an. We cannot come down as the people here are too clever: we are afraid that they might give away what we look like. The Great Sage Monkey and the other two gentlemen cannot go there either. You must go there yourself to hand the scriptures to your monarch then come back here. We wil be waiting for you up in the clouds ready to go to report back on your mission.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although what you respected gentlemen say is right,&rdquo; replied the Great Sage, &ldquo;how could my master possibly shoulder the pole for carrying the scriptures? And how could he lead this horse? We&rsquo;l have to take him there.</p>
<p>May I trouble you to wait a moment up in the air? We wouldn&rsquo;t dare keep you waiting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other day the Bodhisat va Guanyin informed the Tathagata,&rdquo; the vajrapanis replied, &ldquo;that the return journey would take only eight days, so as to make up the number of rol s of scriptures in the Tripitaka. We have already 1577</p>
<p>spent over four days, and we are worried that Pig wil be so greedy for blessings and honors that he wil make us overrun the time limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The master&rsquo;s a Buddha now,&rdquo; Pig replied with a smile, &ldquo;and I want to become one too. So why should I want to be greedy? Cheeky great fools!</p>
<p>Wait here while we hand the scriptures over, then we&rsquo;l come back to return with you.&rdquo; The idiot then shouldered a pole while Friar Sand held the horse and Brother Monkey led the holy monk as they brought their cloud down to land beside the Watching For the Scriptures Tower.</p>
<p>When Taizong and his officials al saw this they came down to greet the travelers with the words, &ldquo;You are back, Imperial Younger Brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Tang Priest fel to the ground in a kowtow, only to be helped back to his feet by Taizong, who asked, &ldquo;Who are these three?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are disciples I took on along the way,&rdquo; Sanzang replied. Taizong was delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harness the horses to our imperial carriage,&rdquo; he ordered his aides, &ldquo;and invite the Imperial Younger Brother to mount his steed and return to the palace with us.&rdquo; The Tang Priest thanked him and mounted his horse. The Great Sage fol owed closely behind, whirling his golden cudgel. Pig and Friar Sand led the horse and shouldered the pole as they fol owed the emperor back to Chang&rsquo;an. Indeed:</p>
<p>In that year of peace and rising prosperity</p>
<p>Civil and military officials are calm and magnificent.</p>
<p>At a land and water mass the clergy displayed the dharma; The monarch commands his ministers in the throne hal of the palace.</p>
<p>A passport was given to Tang Sanzang;</p>
<p>The primal cause of the scriptures has been matched to the Five Elements.</p>
<p>Through painful tempering al monsters have been destroyed; Now he returns in triumph to the capital.</p>
<p>The Tang Priest and his three disciples fol owed the imperial carriage back to the palace. Everybody in the capital knew that the pilgrim who had gone to fetch the scriptures had now returned.</p>
<p>When the monks, young and old, of the Hongfu Monastery in Chang&rsquo;an where the Tang Priest used to live saw that the tops of a number of pine trees were al leaning towards the East they exclaimed in astonishment, &ldquo;Odd, very odd! There&rsquo;s been no wind today, so why are the tops of these trees al 1578</p>
<p>bent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fetch our vestments at once,&rdquo; said one of them who was a former disciple of Sanzang. &ldquo;The master who went to fetch the scriptures is back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; the other monks al asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the master left many years ago,&rdquo; the former disciple replied, &ldquo;he said that when the branches and tops of the pines turned East three, four, six or seven years after he had gone he would be back. My master speaks with the holy voice of a Buddha: that is how I know.&rdquo; They quickly put on their habits and went out.</p>
<p>By the time they reached the Western street, messengers had arrived to say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pilgrim who went for the scriptures has just returned, and His Majesty is bringing him into the city.&ldquo;As soon as they heard this the monks al hurried over to meet him. When they saw the imperial carriage they dared not come close, but fol owed it to the palace gates, where the Tang Priest dismounted and went inside with his disciples.</p>
<p>The Tang Priest stood at the foot of the steps to the throne hal with the dragon horse, the load of sutras, Monkey, Pig and Friar Sand. Emperor Taizong then summoned the Younger Brother to enter the throne hal and invited him to sit down, which the Tang Priest did with thanks. He then had the scriptures carried up. Monkey and the others unpacked the scrol s, which the officials in personal at endance handed to the emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many scriptures are there?&rdquo; the emperor asked. &ldquo;And how did you fetch them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your clerical subject reached Vulture Peak and saw the Lord Buddha,&rdquo; Sanzang replied, &ldquo;he told the arhats Ananda and Kasyapa to take us first to a precious tower where we were given meatless food, then to the library, where we were handed the scriptures. The arhats demanded presents, but as we had not brought any we had none to give. Then they gave us the scriptures. When we had thanked the Buddha for his goodness and were travel ing East the scriptures were snatched away by a demonic gale. Luckily my disciples were able to recover them by using magic powers, but they had been blown al over the place. On opening them out to look at them we found that they were al blank, wordless versions. We were so shocked that we went back to report to the Buddha and plead for the real ones. What the Lord Buddha said was, &lsquo;When these scriptures were composed, bhiksus and holy monks went down the mountain and recited them to the family of the elder 1579</p>
<p>Zhao in the land of Sravasti. This ensured peace and safety for the living and deliverance for the dead members of the family. Al that was asked for was three bushels and three pecks of granular gold. I thought that they sold the scriptures too cheap, so I saw to it that Zhao&rsquo;s sons and grandsons would be poor.&rsquo; When we realized that the two arhats were demanding a present and that the Lord Buddha knew al about it we had no choice but to give them our begging bowl of purple gold. Only then did they hand over the true scriptures with words. There are thirty-five of them, and a number of rol s from each of them was selected to be given us, making a total of rol s. This corresponds to the number of rol s in a single Store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Taizong was more delighted than ever. &ldquo;Let the Protocol Office arrange a thanksgiving banquet in the Eastern hal ,&rdquo; he ordered, at which he suddenly saw the three disciples standing at the foot of the steps, looking very strange indeed. &ldquo;Are your distinguished disciples foreigners?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My senior disciple&rsquo;s surname is Sun,&rdquo; the venerable elder replied with a bow, &ldquo;his Buddhist name is Wukong, and I also cal him Sun the Novice. He original y came from the Water Curtain Cave on the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit in the country of Aolai in the Eastern Continent of Divine Body. For making great havoc in the palaces of heaven five hundred years ago he was crashed by the Lord Buddha in a stone cel in the Double Boundary Mountain on the Western frontier. After the Bodhisat va Guanyin persuaded him to mend his ways he accepted conversion, so when I arrived there I delivered him. I am greatly indebted to him for my protection. My second disciple Zhu has the Buddhist name Wuneng, and I also cal him Pig. He came from the Cloud Pathway Cave on the Mountain of Blessing, and was a monster in Gao Vil age in the land of Stubet until he was converted by the Bodhisat va and subdued by Wukong. He has made great efforts, carrying the load al along the way, and been very useful in crossing rivers. My third disciple&rsquo;s surname is Sha and his Buddhist name Wujing. He used to be a monster in the Rowing Sands River. He too was converted by the Bodhisat va and now believes in the Buddhist faith. The horse is not the one that my sovereign gave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; Taizong asked. &ldquo;Its markings are the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When your subject was going to cross the waters of the Eagle&rsquo;s Sorrow Gorge by Coiled Snake Mountain my original horse was devoured by this one,&rdquo; Sanzang replied. &ldquo;Sun the Novice obliged me by having the 1580</p>
<p>Bodhisat va asked about the horse&rsquo;s background. It was original y the son of the Dragon King of the Western Sea who had been sent there because of an offence. He too, was saved by the Bodhisat va, who told him to work for me and turned him into a horse with the same markings as the original one. He has been very helpful in climbing mountains, crossing ridges, fording rivers and negotiating difficult country. On the outward journey I rode him, and he carried the scriptures on the way back: I have depended greatly on his efforts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taizong was ful of boundless praise on learning this. &ldquo;How long in fact was your journey to the far West?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember the Bodhisat va saying that it was 36,000 miles,&rdquo; Sanzang replied, &ldquo;but I kept no record of the distances along the way.Al I know is that we experienced fourteen winters and summers. Every day there was a mountain or a ridge. The woods were big and the rivers wide. I also met several kings who inspected and stamped my passport. Disciples,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;fetch the passport and hand it to His Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Taizong examined it he saw that it had been issued on the twelfth day of the ninth month of the thirteenth year of Zhen Guan. &ldquo;You did indeed make a long and protracted journey,&rdquo; he observed with a touch of a smile. &ldquo;It is now the twenty-seventh year of Zhen Guan.&rdquo; On the passport were the seals of the monarchs of Elephantia, Wuji, Tarrycart, the Womanland of Western Liang, Jisai, Purpuria, Leonia, Bhiksuland and Dharmadestructia; as wel as the seals of the chief officials of Fengxian, Yuhua and Jinping. When Taizong had read through the passport he put it away.</p>
<p>Soon the officials in personal at endance on the emperor came to invite them to go to the banquet, whereupon Taizong led Sanzang by the hand out of the throne hal , asking, &ldquo;Do your distinguished disciples know how to behave themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My disciples were al demons from mountain vil ages and from the wilderness,&rdquo; Sanzang replied, &ldquo;so they do not understand the etiquet e of the sacred court of China. I beg you to forgive them for any offences, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t blame them,&rdquo; Taizong said with a smile, &ldquo;we won&rsquo;t blame them.</p>
<p>They are al invited to come with us to the banquet in the Eastern pavilion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanking him once again, Sanzang cal ed his three disciples, and they al went to the Eastern pavilion to look. This was indeed the great land of China, 1581</p>
<p>no ordinary place. Just look;</p>
<p>Coloured silks hung from the gates,</p>
<p>Red carpets were spread on the floor.</p>
<p>Heavy, rare fragrances,</p>
<p>Fresh and exotic foods.</p>
<p>Amber cups,</p>
<p>Glazed dishes,</p>
<p>Set with gold and nephrite;</p>
<p>Plates of yel ow gold,</p>
<p>White jade bowls,</p>
<p>Inlaid with pat erns.</p>
<p>Tender braised turnips,</p>
<p>Sugar-dredged taros,</p>
<p>Wonderful sweet mushrooms,</p>
<p>Fine fresh seaweed,</p>
<p>Several servings of bamboo shoots with ginger, A number of rounds of mal ows with honey,</p>
<p>Wheat gluten with leaves of the tree of heaven, Tree fungus and thin strips of beancurd,</p>
<p>Agar and aster,</p>
<p>Noodles with ferns and dried rose-petals,</p>
<p>Peppers stewed with radish,</p>
<p>Melon shredded with mustard.</p>
<p>The dishes of vegetables were fine enough,</p>
<p>But the rare and wonderful fruit was outstanding: Walnuts and persimmon cakes,</p>
<p>Longans and lichees,</p>
<p>Chestnuts from Xuanzhou and Shandong jujubes, Gingko fruit from South of the Yangtse and hare-head pears, Hazelnuts, pine nuts and lotus seeds, al big as grapes, Torreya nuts and melon seeds the size of water chestnuts, Olives and wild apples,</p>
<p>Pippins and crabs,</p>
<p>Lotus root and arrowhead,</p>
<p>Crisp plums and red baybfenies.</p>
<p>Nothing was missing,</p>
<p>1582</p>
<p>Al was complete.</p>
<p>There were steamed honey pastries and other confections, Best wines and fragrant tea and things out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>Words could not describe the countless delicacies: The great land of China was not Western barbary.</p>
<p>The master and his three disciples, together with the civil and military officials, stood to left and right as Emperor Taizong took his seat in the middle. There was singing, dancing and instrumental music, and al was ordered and solemn as the celebration lasted for the rest of the day. Indeed: The monarch&rsquo;s banquet was finer than those of ancient Tang and Yu; Great was the blessing of the true scriptures obtained.</p>
<p>This was a story to be told with glory for ever: The light of the Buddha shines throughout the imperial capital.</p>
<p>That evening they thanked the emperor for his kindness, after which Taizong returned to the living quarters of the palace and the officials went home. The Tang Priest went back with his fol owers to the Hongfu Monastery, where the monks welcomed his with kowtows.</p>
<p>No sooner had he gone in through the gates than the monks reported,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master, these tree-tops al suddenly leaned East this morning. As we remembered what you had said we went out of the city to meet you, and you had indeed come.&rdquo; Overcome with delight, the venerable elder then entered the abbot&rsquo;s lodgings. This time Pig neither shouted for tea and food nor made a row. Brother Monkey and Friar Sand also both behaved wel . As the achievement was now complete they were natural y peaceful. At nightfal they went to bed.</p>
<p>Early the next morning Taizong announced to his officials at his dawn audience, &ldquo;When we thought of the most profound and great achievement of our Younger Brother that we have no way of rewarding we were unable to sleep al night. We managed to draft a few col oquial sentences with which to express our thanks, but could not write them out. Officials of the Secretariat,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;write them al down while we recite them to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the text he dictated: It is known that Heaven and Earth have their forms as a demonstration of how they provide the cover and support in which life is contained, whereas the four seasons are invisible, hiding the cold and heat with which they transform al creatures. Thus it is that by examining Heaven and looking at the Earth even the stupid can know about their origins, 1583</p>
<p>but few are the wise who can exhaust the numbers of the Negative and the Positive. Heaven and Earth, which are enveloped by the Negative and Positive, are easily understood because of their images, but the Negative and Positive are hard to fathom because they are formless. If images are clear and can be grasped even the stupid wil not be confused; if forms are hidden and invisible even the wise wil be at a loss.</p>
<p>The way of the Buddha honors emptiness, rides on the mystery and controls silence, yet saves al beings and dominates al regions. When it raises up the numinous there is nothing higher; when it represses its own divine strength there is nothing lower. When it is big it extends throughout the cosmos; when tiny it can be contained in a fraction of an inch. It does not die and it is not born; it endures a thousand aeons and is eternal. Half hidden and half manifest, it controls al blessings and makes them exist for ever. Mysterious is the wonderful Way; none of those who fol ow it know its limits. Silent is the flow of the Dharma: of those who grasp it none finds its source. So how can mortal fools in their stupidity fol ow it without doubts or delusion?</p>
<p>The great teaching arose in the West. Later a wondrous dream came to the Han court, spreading its bril iance and charity to the East. In ancient times, when the Buddha&rsquo;s forms and traces were shared around, they converted people before word could be spread abroad. In the age when they were sometimes visible and sometimes invisible, the people looked up to them and fol owed them. But later the image was obscures and nirvana was reached, it moved away and left the world, the golden countenance was hidden away and no longer radiated its bril iance in the three thousand worlds. Pictures of the lovely image were made, vainly trying to show the Buddha&rsquo;s thirty-two holy marks. Thereafter his subtle words were widely propagated, rescuing birds on the three roads of life; the teachings he left behind were spread afar, guiding al living beings along the ten stages of development. The Buddha has scriptures that can be divided into the Greater and Lesser Vehicles. There is also magic, the art of spreading mistakes and making right into wrong.</p>
<p>Now our priest Xuanzang, the Master of the Law, is the leader of the Dharma faith. In his youth he was so careful and perceptive that he soon became aware of the value of the three voids. As he grew up the clarity of his spirit embraced the four kinds of patience in his conduct. Not even a pine tree in a wind or the moon reflected in water could be compared with his purity; 1584</p>
<p>immortals&rsquo;dew and bright pearls are no match for his lustrous splendor. His wisdom encompasses al without encumbrance; his spirit fathoms the formless. Rising far above the six impurities, he extends his fragrance through a thousand ages. When he concentrated his mind on the inner sphere he grieved at the torments suffered by the true Dharma; when he set led his thoughts on the gate of mystery he was distressed by the distortion of the profound writings. He longed to put them back into order so that the teachings of the past could be propagated again; and to root out apocryphal texts, enabling the true ones to stay in circulation so as to open the way for later scholars. That is why he lifted up his heart towards the Pure Land, and made a Dharma journey to the West, braving the dangers of distant lands as he walked alone, trusting to his staff. When the snow whirled around at dawn the land would disappear in a moment; and when the dust started to fly at evening the sky was blot ed out. He advanced through the mists across a thousand leagues of mountains and rivers, making his way forward through the frosts and rains of a hundred changes of season. With great single-mindedness and making light of his efforts he longed deeply to reach his goal. He wandered around the West for fourteen years, visiting every one of those exotic countries in his search for the true teaching. He visited the Twin Trees and the Eight Rivers, savoring the Way and braving the wind. In Deer Park and on Vulture Peak he gazed upon wonders and marvels. He received the good word from ancient sages and the true teaching from superior worthies, probing deep within the wonderful gates, and exhausting the mysteries. The Way of the Three Vehicles and the Six Disciplines gal op across the field of his heart; a hundred cases of texts belonging to one Store rol like waves in the sea of his eloquence. Infinitely many are the countries he has visited; and vast the number of the scriptures he has col ected.</p>
<p>He has obtained 5,048 rol s of al thirty-five of the essential texts of the Great Vehicle to be translated and made known in China so that the wonderful cause may be promoted. The clouds of mercy he has drawn from the far West wil shed their Dharma rain here in the East. The holy teachings that had been incomplete are now complete once more; the common folk who had sinned are brought back to blessings. The searing flames of fire have been damped down, and al have been saved from the ways of delusion; the muddied waves in the water of wisdom have been made clear once more as al gather on the other bank. From this it can be learned that the evil fal 1585</p>
<p>because of their karma, while the good rise because of their destiny. The origins of these rises and fal s lie in one&rsquo;s own actions. This can be compared with a cassia growing on a high mountain, where only clouds and dew can nourish its blossom, or a lotus emerging from green waters, its leaves unsul ied by flying dust. It is not that the lotus is pure by nature and the cassia unsul ied: they are good because one at aches itself to what is lofty, where mean and trivial things cannot encumber it, while the other depends on what is clean, where filth cannot dirty it. Now if plants that know nothing can become good by building themselves up through goodness, how much the more so should conscientious people achieve blessing through blessed cause and effect. It is now to be hoped that the true scriptures wil be propagated as endlessly as the alternation of sun and moon; and that this blessing wil extend for ever, eternal like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>As soon as this had been writ en out the holy monk, who was waiting outside the palace gates to express his thanks, was summoned. The moment he heard the summons, Sanzang hurried and performed the ritual of kowtows. Taizong then invited him into the throne room and handed him the document, Sanzang read it through, prostrated himself once more in thanks, and submit ed this memorial: &ldquo;Your Majesty&rsquo;s writing is both lofty and in the ancient style; it is reasoned, profound and subtle. But I do not know what its title is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we drafted oral y last night,&rdquo; Taizong replied, &ldquo;We would cal a</p>
<p>&lsquo;Preface to the Holy Teaching&rsquo;. Would that be acceptable?&rdquo; The venerable elder kowtowed and expressed his thanks at great length.</p>
<p>Taizong then said, &ldquo;Our talent makes us ashamed by comparison with what is recorded on jade tablets; our words are not worthy of what is inscribed on metal or stone. As for the Inner Scriptures, we are even more ignorant of them. The text we drafted oral y is truly a base and clumsy composition that sul ies golden tablets with brush and ink, and is like placing pebbles in a forest of pearls. When we reflect on it we are fil ed with embarrassment. It is most unworthy of merit; we have put you to the trouble of thanking us for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officials al expressed their congratulations and kowtowed before the imperial text on the holy teaching, which was going to be published everywhere in the capital and the provinces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you be wil ing to recite some of the true scriptures for us, Younger 1586</p>
<p>Brother?&rdquo; Taizong asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Majesty,&rdquo; Sanzang replied, &ldquo;if true scriptures are to be recited it must be done in the Buddha&rsquo;s ground. A throne hal is no place for the recital of scriptures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taizong was most pleased to accept this. &ldquo;Which is the purest monastery in the city of Chang&rsquo;an?&rdquo; he asked his officers it at endance, at which the Academician Xiao Yu slipped forward from his rank to memorialize, &ldquo;The Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa in the city is the purest of them al .&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taizong then ordered his officials, &ldquo;Each of you is reverently to bring a few rol s of the true scriptures and accompany us to the Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa, where we shal invite our younger brother to preach on the scriptures.&rdquo; The officials, al carrying some rol s of the scriptures, went with Taizong to the monastery, where a high platform was erected and everything was neatly set out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pig, Friar Sand,&rdquo; the venerable elder commanded, &ldquo;bring the dragon horse with you and put the luggage in order. Monkey wil stay beside me.&rdquo; He then addressed the emperor, saying, &ldquo;If Your Majesty wishes to spread the true scriptures throughout the world copies must be made before they can be published. The original texts must be stored as great treasures. They may not be shown any disrespect or be defiled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Younger Brother,&rdquo; replied Taizong with a smile, &ldquo;what you say is very correct, very correct.&rdquo; He then ordered the officials of the Hanlin Academy and the Palace Secretariat to copy out the true scriptures and had another monastery, the Copying Monastery, founded to the East of the city wal .</p>
<p>The venerable elder mounted the platform with several scriptures in his hands. He was just about to begin reciting them when scented breezes began to waft around and the Eight Great Vajrapanis appeared in mid-air to shout aloud, &ldquo;Scripture-reciter, put those scriptures down and come back to the West with us.&rdquo; Monkey and the other two, who were standing below Sanzang, al rose up above the ground together with the white horse. Sanzang put the scriptures down and also rose up to the ninth level of clouds, then went away with them through the air. Taizong and his officials were al so alarmed that they kowtowed to the sky. This was indeed a case of The holy monk long strove to fetch the scriptures; For fourteen years across the West he strayed.</p>
<p>He journeyed hard and met with much disaster; 1587</p>
<p>By mountains and by rivers long delayed.</p>
<p>Completing eight times nine and one nine more, His deeds fil ed worlds in numbers beyond measure.</p>
<p>He went back to his country taking sutras</p>
<p>That people in the East wil always treasure.</p>
<p>When Taizong and al the officials had finished worshipping, eminent monks were selected to prepare a great Land and Sea Mass in the Monastery of the Wild Goose Stupa at which the true scriptures of the Great Store would be recited, and by which al evil-doing ghosts in the underworld would be saved, and goodness would spread al around. We wil not describe how copies were made of the scriptures and published throughout the empire.</p>
<p>The story tel s instead how the Eight Vajrapanis led the venerable elder, his three disciples and the horse, al five of them back to Vulture Peak. The journey to Chang&rsquo;an and back had taken eight days. Just when al the deities of Vulture Peak were listening to the Buddha preaching, the Eight Vajrapanis led master and disciples in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In obedience to the golden command,&rdquo; they reported to the Tathagata, &ldquo;your disciples have carried the holy monks back to the land of Tang, where they handed the scriptures over. We have now come to report our mission completed.&rdquo; The Tang Priest and his disciples were then told to step forward and be given their jobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy Monk,&rdquo; the Tathagata said, &ldquo;in an earlier life you were my second disciple, and cal ed Master Golden Cicada. But because you would not listen to my sermon on the Dharma and had no respect for my great teaching I demoted your soul to be reborn in the East. Now, happily, you have come over to the faith and rely on our support; and in fol owing our teaching your achievement in fetching the true scriptures has been very great. Your reward wil be to be promoted to high office as the Candana-punya Buddha. Sun Wukong, when you made great havoc in the palaces of heaven I had to use powerful magic to crush you under the Five Elements Mountain until, happily, your heaven-sent punishment was completed and you were converted to the Sakyamuni&rsquo;s faith. It was also fortunate that you suppressed your evil side and gave play to your good side as you won glory by defeating monsters and demons along the journey. Al that was begun has now been completed and you too wil be rewarded with high office as the Victorious Fighting Buddha. Zhu Wuneng; you used to be a water god in the River of 1588</p>
<p>Heaven as Marshal Tian Peng. Because of your drunken flirtation with an immortal maiden at the Peach Banquet you were sent down to be born in the lower world as a beast. From your love of the human body you sinned in the Cloud Pathway Cave on the Mount of Blessing before your conversion to the great faith and entry into our Buddhist sect. You guarded the holy monk on his journey, but your heart is stil unregenerate, and you are not yet purged of your lust. But as you won merit by carrying the luggage you wil be rewarded with promotion as the Altar Cleanser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve both been made Buddhas,&rdquo; Pig shouted, &ldquo;so why am I only the Altar Cleanser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you have a voracious appetite, a lazy body and a huge bel y,&rdquo; the Tathagata replied. &ldquo;Now very many people in the world&rsquo;s four continents believe in our teachings. I wil ask you to clean up the altars after al Buddhist services: your post is of a rank that provides plenty to eat. What is wrong with that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sha Wujing, you used to be the Curtain-lifting General until you were banished to the lower world for smashing a crystal bowl at a Peach Banquet.</p>
<p>You fel into the River of Flowing Sands where you sinned by kil ing and eating people, until, thank goodness, you were converted to our teaching, sincerely relied on our support, and won merit by protecting the holy monk and leading the horse up the mountain. Your reward wil be elevation to high office as the Golden Arhat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he said to the white horse. &ldquo;You were original y the son of Guangjin, the Dragon King of the Western Ocean. Because you disobeyed your father you were punished for being unfilial until you too were converted to the Dharma and to our faith. Every day you carried the holy monk to the West, and after that you carried the holy scriptures back to the East. For these achievements you wil be rewarded by being made a Heavenly Dragon of the Eight Classes of Being.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The venerable elder and his three disciples al kowtowed to express their thanks, and the horse showed its gratitude too. A protector was then ordered to take the horse straight down to the Dragon-transforming Pool by the precipice at the back of Vulture Peak and push him into the pool.At once the horse stretched itself out, shed al its hair, and acquired horns. Golden scales grew al over its body and a silver beard sprouted on its cheeks and chin.</p>
<p>Then, shining al over with auspicious aura and with clouds of good omen in 1589</p>
<p>every claw, it flew up from the Dragon-transforming Pool to coil itself around the Heaven-supporting Winged Column. Al the Buddhas expressed their admiration for the Tathagata&rsquo;s great magic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; Monkey said to the Tang Priest, &ldquo;now that I&rsquo;ve become a Buddha just like you, surely I don&rsquo;t have to go on wearing this golden band. Do you plan to say any more Band-tightening Spel s to tighten it round my head?</p>
<p>Say a Band-loosening Spel as quickly as you can, take it off, and smash it to smithereens. Don&rsquo;t let that Bodhisat va or whatever she is make life miserable for anyone else with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was because you were so uncontrol able in those days that this magic was needed to keep you in order.&rdquo; Sanzang replied. &ldquo;Now that you are a Buddha it can of course go. There is no reason for it to stay on your head any longer.</p>
<p>Feel there now.&rdquo; When Monkey raised his hands to feel he found that it had indeed gone. The Candana-punya Buddha, the Victorious Fighting Buddha, the Altar Cleanser and the Golden Arhat had al completed the true achievement and reached their proper places. The heavenly dragon horse had also come back to its true self. There is a poem to prove this that goes: Al of reality turns to dust;</p>
<p>When the four appearances combine the body is renewed.</p>
<p>The substance of the Five Elements is al void; Forget about the passing fame of fiends.</p>
<p>With Candana-punya comes the great awakening; When duties are completed they escape from suffering.</p>
<p>Great is the blessing of scriptures spread abroad; Within the only gate five sages dwel on high.</p>
<p>When the five holy ones had taken their places al the Buddhas, Bodhisat vas, holy monks, arhats, protectors, bhiksus, lay people, deities and immortals from every cave and every mountain, great gods, Ding and Jia gods, duty gods, guardians, local deities, and al teachers and immortals who had achieved the Way&mdash;al of whom had original y come to hear the preaching&mdash;</p>
<p>resumed their own places. Just look at it:</p>
<p>The coloured mists surround the Vulture Peak; Auspicious clouds are massed in the world of bliss.</p>
<p>Golden dragons lie at peace,</p>
<p>Jade tigers al are quiet.</p>
<p>Black hares come and go at wil ;</p>
<p>1590</p>
<p>Tortoises and snakes coil al around.</p>
<p>Phoenixes red and green are in high spirits;</p>
<p>Happy the dark apes and white deer.</p>
<p>Throughout the year amazing flowers bloom;</p>
<p>Immortal fruit grows in al four seasons.</p>
<p>Lofty pine and ancient juniper,</p>
<p>Blue-green cypress and slender bamboo.</p>
<p>Plums of every color, in blossom or in fruit, Eternal peaches, sometimes ripe and sometimes new.</p>
<p>A thousand kinds of fruit and flower vie in beauty; Al of the sky is fil ed with auspicious mists.</p>
<p>They al put their hands together in front of their chests in salutation and recited together:</p>
