    <h1>13</h1>
    <p>&quot;This one devised by Mr. Tertius,&quot; the eunuch was further heard to say, &quot;is not properly done; and as Her Majesty herself has been unable to guess it she commanded me to bring it back, and ask Mr. Tertius what it is about.&quot;</p>
<p>After the party had listened to these words, they all pressed forward to see what had been written. The burden of it was this:</p>
<p>  The elder brother has horns only eight;<br>
  The second brother has horns only two;<br>
  The elder brother on the bed doth sit;<br>
  Inside the room the second likes to squat.\</p>
<p>After perusal of these lines, they broke out, with one voice, into a loud fit of laughter; and Chia Huan had to explain to the eunuch that the one was a pillow, and the other the head of an animal. Having committed the explanation to memory and accepted a cup of tea, the eunuch took his departure; and old lady Chia, noticing in what buoyant spirits Yüan Ch'un was, felt herself so much the more elated, that issuing forthwith directions to devise, with every despatch, a small but ingenious lantern of fine texture in the shape of a screen, and put it in the Hall, she bade each of her grandchildren secretly compose a conundrum, copy it out clean, and affix it on the frame of the lantern; and she had subsequently scented tea and fine fruits, as well as every kind of nicknacks, got ready, as prizes for those who guessed right.</p>
<p>And when Chia Cheng came from court and found the old lady in such high glee he also came over in the evening, as the season was furthermore holiday time, to avail himself of her good cheer to reap some enjoyment. In the upper part of the room seated themselves, at one table dowager lady Chia, Chia Cheng, and Pao-yü; madame Wang, Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yü, Hsiang-yün sat round another table, and Ying-ch'un, Tan-ch'un and Hsi Ch'un the three of them, occupied a separate table, and both these tables were laid in the lower part, while below, all over the floor, stood matrons and waiting-maids for Li Kung-ts'ai and Hsi-feng were both seated in the inner section of the Hall, at another table.</p>
<p>Chia Chen failed to see Chia Lan, and he therefore inquired: &quot;How is it I don't see brother Lan,&quot; whereupon the female servants, standing below, hastily entered the inner room and made inquiries of widow Li. &quot;He says,&quot; Mrs. Li stood up and rejoined with a smile, &quot;that as your master didn't go just then to ask him round, he has no wish to come!&quot; and when a matron delivered the reply to Chia Cheng; the whole company exclaimed much amused: &quot;How obstinate and perverse his natural disposition is!&quot; But Chia Cheng lost no time in sending Chia Huan, together with two matrons, to fetch Chia Lan; and, on his arrival, dowager lady Chia bade him sit by her side, and, taking a handful of fruits, she gave them to him to eat; after which the party chatted, laughed, and enjoyed themselves.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, there was no one but Pao-yü to say much or talk at any length, but on this day, with Chia Cheng present, his remarks were limited to assents. And as to the rest, Hsiang-yün had, though a young girl, and of delicate physique, nevertheless ever been very fond of talking and discussing; but, on this instance, Chia Cheng was at the feast, so that she also held her tongue and restrained her words. As for Tai-yü she was naturally peevish and listless, and not very much inclined to indulge in conversation; while Pao-ch'ai, who had never been reckless in her words or frivolous in her deportment, likewise behaved on the present occasion in her usual dignified manner. Hence it was that this banquet, although a family party, given for the sake of relaxation, assumed contrariwise an appearance of restraint, and as old lady Chia was herself too well aware that it was to be ascribed to the presence of Chia Cheng alone, she therefore, after the wine had gone round three times, forthwith hurried off Chia Cheng to retire to rest.</p>
<p>No less cognisant was Chia Cheng himself that the old lady's motives in packing him off were to afford a favourable opportunity to the young ladies and young men to enjoy themselves, and that is why, forcing a smile, he observed: &quot;Having to-day heard that your venerable ladyship had got up in here a large assortment of excellent riddles, on the occasion of the spring festival of lanterns, I too consequently prepared prizes, as well as a banquet, and came with the express purpose of joining the company; and why don't you in some way confer a fraction of the fond love, which you cherish for your grandsons and granddaughters, upon me also, your son?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When you're here,&quot; old lady Chia replied smilingly, &quot;they won't venture to chat or laugh; and unless you go, you'll really fill me with intense dejection! But if you feel inclined to guess conundrums, well, I'll tell you one for you to solve; but if you don't guess right, mind, you'll be mulcted!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I'll submit to the penalty,&quot; Chia Cheng rejoined eagerly, as he laughed, &quot;but if I do guess right, I must in like manner receive a reward!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This goes without saying!&quot; dowager lady Chia added; whereupon she went on to recite:</p>
<p>The monkey's body gently rests on the tree top!</p>
<p>&quot;This refers,&quot; she said, &quot;to the name of a fruit.&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Cheng was already aware that it was a lichee, but he designedly made a few guesses at random, and was fined several things; but he subsequently gave, at length, the right answer, and also obtained a present from her ladyship.</p>
<p>In due course he too set forth this conundrum for old lady Chia to guess:</p>
<p>  Correct its body is in appearance,<br>
  Both firm and solid is it in substance;<br>
  To words, it is true, it cannot give vent,<br>
  But spoken to, it always does assent.\</p>
<p>When he had done reciting it, he communicated the answer in an undertone to Pao-yü; and Pao-yü fathoming what his intention was, gently too told his grandmother Chia, and her ladyship finding, after some reflection, that there was really no mistake about it, readily remarked that it was an inkslab.</p>
<p>&quot;After all,&quot; Chia Cheng smiled; &quot;Your venerable ladyship it is who can hit the right answer with one guess!&quot; and turning his head round, &quot;Be quick,&quot; he cried, &quot;and bring the prizes and present them!&quot; whereupon the married women and waiting-maids below assented with one voice, and they simultaneously handed up the large trays and small boxes.</p>
<p>Old lady Chia passed the things, one by one, under inspection; and finding that they consisted of various kinds of articles, novel and ingenious, of use and of ornament, in vogue during the lantern festival, her heart was so deeply elated that with alacrity she shouted, &quot;Pour a glass of wine for your master!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü took hold of the decanter, while Ying Ch'un presented the cup of wine.</p>
<p>&quot;Look on that screen!&quot; continued dowager lady Chia, &quot;all those riddles have been written by the young ladies; so go and guess them for my benefit!&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Cheng signified his obedience, and rising and walking up to the front of the screen, he noticed the first riddle, which was one composed by the Imperial consort Yüan, in this strain:</p>
<p>  The pluck of devils to repress in influence it abounds,<br>
  Like bound silk is its frame, and like thunder its breath resounds.<br>
  But one report rattles, and men are lo! in fear and dread;<br>
  Transformed to ashes 'tis what time to see you turn the head.\</p>
<p>&quot;Is this a cracker?&quot; Chia Cheng inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;It is,&quot; Pao-yü assented.</p>
<p>Chia Cheng then went on to peruse that of Ying-Ch'un's, which referred to an article of use:</p>
<p>  Exhaustless is the principle of heavenly calculations and of human<br>
      skill;<br>
  Skill may exist, but without proper practice the result to find hard<br>
      yet<br>
  will be!<br>
  Whence cometh all this mixed confusion on a day so still?<br>
  Simply it is because the figures Yin and Yang do not agree.\</p>
<p>&quot;It's an abacus,&quot; Chia Cheng observed.</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so!&quot; replied Ying Ch'un smiling; after which they also conned the one below, by T'an-ch'un, which ran thus and had something to do with an object:</p>
<p>  This is the time when 'neath the stairs the pages their heads raise!<br>
  The term of &quot;pure brightness&quot; is the meetest time this thing to make!<br>
  The vagrant silk it snaps, and slack, without tension it strays!<br>
  The East wind don't begrudge because its farewell it did take!\</p>
<p>&quot;It would seem,&quot; Chia Cheng suggested, &quot;as if that must be a kite!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It is,&quot; answered T'an C'h'un; whereupon Chia Cheng read the one below, which was written by Tai-yü to this effect and bore upon some thing:</p>
<p>  After the audience, his two sleeves who brings with fumes replete?<br>
  Both by the lute and in the quilt, it lacks luck to abide!<br>
  The dawn it marks; reports from cock and man renders effete!<br>
  At midnight, maids no trouble have a new one to provide!<br>
  The head, it glows during the day, as well as in the night!<br>
  Its heart, it burns from day to day and 'gain from year to year!<br>
  Time swiftly flies and mete it is that we should hold it dear!<br>
  Changes might come, but it defies wind, rain, days dark or bright!\</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't this a scented stick to show the watch?&quot; Chia Cheng inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes!&quot; assented Pao-yü, speaking on Tai-yü's behalf; and Chia Cheng thereupon prosecuted the perusal of a conundrum, which ran as follows, and referred to an object;</p>
<p>  With the South, it sits face to face,<br>
  And the North, the while, it doth face;<br>
  If the figure be sad, it also is sad,<br>
  If the figure be glad, it likewise is glad!\</p>
<p>&quot;Splendid! splendid!&quot; exclaimed Chia Cheng, &quot;my guess is that it's a looking-glass. It's excellently done!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü smiled. &quot;It is a looking glass!&quot; he rejoined.</p>
<p>&quot;This is, however, anonymous; whose work is it?&quot; Chia Cheng went on to ask, and dowager lady Chia interposed: &quot;This, I fancy, must have been composed by Pao-yü,&quot; and Chia Cheng then said not a word, but continued reading the following conundrum, which was that devised by Pao-ch'ai, on some article or other:</p>
<p>  Eyes though it has; eyeballs it has none, and empty 'tis inside!<br>
  The lotus flowers out of the water peep, and they with gladness meet,<br>
  But when dryandra leaves begin to drop, they then part and divide,<br>
  For a fond pair they are, but, united, winter they cannot greet.\</p>
<p>When Chia Cheng finished scanning it, he gave way to reflection. &quot;This object,&quot; he pondered, &quot;must surely be limited in use! But for persons of tender years to indulge in all this kind of language, would seem to be still less propitious; for they cannot, in my views, be any of them the sort of people to enjoy happiness and longevity!&quot; When his reflections reached this point, he felt the more dejected, and plainly betrayed a sad appearance, and all he did was to droop his head and to plunge in a brown study.</p>
<p>But upon perceiving the frame of mind in which Chia Cheng was, dowager lady Chia arrived at the conclusion that he must be fatigued; and fearing, on the other hand, that if she detained him, the whole party of young ladies would lack the spirit to enjoy themselves, she there and then faced Chia Cheng and suggested: &quot;There's no need really for you to remain here any longer, and you had better retire to rest; and let us sit a while longer; after which, we too will break up!&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Chia Cheng caught this hint, he speedily assented several consecutive yes's; and when he had further done his best to induce old lady Chia to have a cup of wine, he eventually withdrew out of the Hall. On his return to his bedroom, he could do nothing else than give way to cogitation, and, as he turned this and turned that over in his mind, he got still more sad and pained.</p>
<p>&quot;Amuse yourselves now!&quot; readily exclaimed dowager lady Chia, during this while, after seeing Chia Cheng off; but this remark was barely finished, when she caught sight of Pao-yü run up to the lantern screen, and give vent, as he gesticulated with his hands and kicked his feet about, to any criticisms that first came to his lips. &quot;In this,&quot; he remarked, &quot;this line isn't happy; and that one, hasn't been suitably solved!&quot; while he behaved just like a monkey, whose fetters had been let loose.</p>
<p>&quot;Were the whole party after all,&quot; hastily ventured Tai-yü, &quot;to sit down, as we did a short while back and chat and laugh; wouldn't that be more in accordance with good manners?&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng thereupon egressed from the room in the inner end and interposed her remarks. &quot;Such a being as you are,&quot; she said, &quot;shouldn't surely be allowed by Mr. Chia Cheng, an inch or a step from his side, and then you'll be all right. But just then it slipped my memory, for why didn't I, when your father was present, instigate him to bid you compose a rhythmical enigma; and you would, I have no doubt, have been up to this moment in a state of perspiration!&quot;</p>
<p>At these words, Pao-yü lost all patience, and laying hold of lady Feng, he hustled her about for a few moments.</p>
<p>But old lady Chia went on for some time to bandy words with Li Kung-ts'ai, with the whole company of young ladies and the rest, so that she, in fact, felt considerably tired and worn out; and when she heard that the fourth watch had already drawn nigh, she consequently issued directions that the eatables should be cleared away and given to the crowd of servants, and suggested, as she readily rose to her feet, &quot;Let us go and rest! for the next day is also a feast, and we must get up at an early hour; and to-morrow evening we can enjoy ourselves again!&quot; whereupon the whole company dispersed.</p>
<p>But now, reader, listen to the sequel given in the chapter which follows.</p>

<p>  Pao-yü and Tai-yü make use of some beautiful passages from the Record<br>
      of the Western Side-building to bandy jokes.<br>
  The excellent ballads sung in the Peony Pavilion touch the tender<br>
      heart of Tai-yü.\</p>
<p>Soon after the day on which Chia Yuan-ch'un honoured the garden of Broad Vista with a visit, and her return to the Palace, so our story goes, she forthwith desired that T'an-ch'un should make a careful copy, in consecutive order, of the verses, which had been composed and read out on that occasion, in order that she herself should assign them their rank, and adjudge the good and bad. And she also directed that an inscription should be engraved on a stone, in the Broad Vista park, to serve in future years as a record of the pleasant and felicitous event; and Chia Cheng, therefore, gave orders to servants to go far and wide, and select skilful artificers and renowned workmen, to polish the stone and engrave the characters in the garden of Broad Vista; while Chia Chen put himself at the head of Chia Jung, Chia P'ing and others to superintend the work. And as Chia Se had, on the other hand, the control of Wen Kuan and the rest of the singing girls, twelve in all, as well as of their costumes and other properties, he had no leisure to attend to anything else, and consequently once again sent for Chia Ch'ang and Chia Ling to come and act as overseers.</p>
<p>On a certain day, the works were taken in hand for rubbing the stones smooth with wax, for carving the inscription, and tracing it with vermilion, but without entering into details on these matters too minutely, we will return to the two places, the Yu Huang temple and the Ta Mo monastery. The company of twelve young bonzes and twelve young Taoist priests had now moved out of the Garden of Broad Vista, and Chia Cheng was meditating upon distributing them to various temples to live apart, when unexpectedly Chia Ch'in's mother, née Chou,&mdash;who resided in the back street, and had been at the time contemplating to pay a visit to Chia Cheng on this side so as to obtain some charge, be it either large or small, for her son to look after, that he too should be put in the way of turning up some money to meet his expenses with,&mdash;came, as luck would have it, to hear that some work was in hand in this mansion, and lost no time in driving over in a curricle and making her appeal to lady Feng. And as lady Feng remembered that she had all along not presumed on her position to put on airs, she willingly acceded to her request, and after calling to memory some suitable remarks, she at once went to make her report to madame Wang: &quot;These young bonzes and Taoist priests,&quot; she said, &quot;can by no means be sent over to other places; for were the Imperial consort to come out at an unexpected moment, they would then be required to perform services; and in the event of their being scattered, there will, when the time comes to requisition their help, again be difficulties in the way; and my idea is that it would be better to send them all to the family temple, the Iron Fence Temple; and every month all there will be to do will be to depute some one to take over a few taels for them to buy firewood and rice with, that's all, and when there's even a sound of their being required uttered, some one can at once go and tell them just one word 'come,' and they will come without the least trouble!&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Wang gave a patient ear to this proposal, and, in due course, consulted with Chia Cheng.</p>
<p>&quot;You've really,&quot; smiled Chia Cheng at these words, &quot;reminded me how I should act! Yes, let this be done!&quot; And there and then he sent for Chia Lien.</p>
<p>Chia Lien was, at the time, having his meal with lady Feng, but as soon as he heard that he was wanted, he put by his rice and was just walking off, when lady Feng clutched him and pulled him back. &quot;Wait a while,&quot; she observed with a smirk, &quot;and listen to what I've got to tell you! if it's about anything else, I've nothing to do with it; but if it be about the young bonzes and young Taoists, you must, in this particular matter, please comply with this suggestion of mine,&quot; after which, she went on in this way and that way to put him up to a whole lot of hints.</p>
<p>&quot;I know nothing about it,&quot; Chia Lien rejoined smilingly, &quot;and as you have the knack you yourself had better go and tell him!&quot;</p>
<p>But as soon as lady Feng heard this remark, she stiffened her head and threw down the chopsticks; and, with an expression on her cheeks, which looked like a smile and yet not a smile, she glanced angrily at Chia Lien. &quot;Are you speaking in earnest,&quot; she inquired, &quot;or are you only jesting?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yün Erh, the son of our fifth sister-in-law of the western porch, has come and appealed to me two or three times, asking for something to look after,&quot; Chia Lien laughed, &quot;and I assented and bade him wait; and now, after a great deal of trouble, this job has turned up; and there you are once again snatching it away!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Compose your mind,&quot; lady Feng observed grinning, &quot;for the Imperial Consort has hinted that directions should be given for the planting, in the north-east corner of the park, of a further plentiful supply of pine and cedar trees, and that orders should also be issued for the addition, round the base of the tower, of a large number of flowers and plants and such like; and when this job turns up, I can safely tell you that Yun Erh will be called to assume control of these works.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well if that be really so,&quot; Chia Lien rejoined, &quot;it will after all do! But there's only one thing; all I was up to last night was simply to have some fun with you, but you obstinately and perversely wouldn't.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng, upon hearing these words, burst out laughing with a sound of Ch'ih, and spurting disdainfully at Chia Lien, she lowered her head and went on at once with her meal; during which time Chia Lien speedily walked away laughing the while, and betook himself to the front, where he saw Chia Cheng. It was, indeed, about the young bonzes, and Chia Lien readily carried out lady Feng's suggestion. &quot;As from all appearances,&quot; he continued, &quot;Ch'in Erh has, actually, so vastly improved, this job should, after all, be entrusted to his care and management; and provided that in observance with the inside custom Ch'in Erh were each day told to receive the advances, things will go on all right.&quot; And as Chia Cheng had never had much attention to give to such matters of detail, he, as soon as he heard what Chia Lien had to say, immediately signified his approval and assent. And Chia Lien, on his return to his quarters, communicated the issue to lady Feng; whereupon lady Feng at once sent some one to go and notify dame Chou.</p>
<p>Chia Ch'in came, in due course, to pay a visit to Chia Lien and his wife, and was incessant in his expressions of gratitude; and lady Feng bestowed upon him a further favour by giving him, as a first instalment, an advance of the funds necessary for three months' outlay, for which she bade him write a receipt; while Chia Lien filled up a cheque and signed it; and a counter-order was simultaneously issued, and he came out into the treasury where the sum specified for three months' supplies, amounting to three hundred taels, was paid out in pure ingots.</p>
<p>Chia Ch'in took the first piece of silver that came under his hand, and gave it to the men in charge of the scales, with which he told them to have a cup of tea, and bidding, shortly after, a boy-servant take the money to his home, he held consultation with his mother; after which, he hired a donkey for himself to ride on, and also bespoke several carriages, and came to the back gate of the Jung Kuo mansion; where having called out the twenty young priests, they got into the carriages, and sped straightway beyond the city walls, to the Temple of the Iron Fence, where nothing of any note transpired at the time.</p>
<p>But we will now notice Chia Yüan-ch'un, within the precincts of the Palace. When she had arranged the verses composed in the park of Broad Vista in their order of merit, she suddenly recollected that the sights in the garden were sure, ever since her visit through them, to be diligently and respectfully kept locked up by her father and mother; and that by not allowing any one to go in was not an injustice done to this garden? &quot;Besides,&quot; (she pondered), &quot;in that household, there are at present several young ladies, capable of composing odes, and able to write poetry, and why should not permission be extended to them to go and take their quarters in it; in order too that those winsome persons might not be deprived of good cheer, and that the flowers and willows may not lack any one to admire them!&quot;</p>
<p>But remembering likewise that Pao-yü had from his infancy grown up among that crowd of female cousins, and was such a contrast to the rest of his male cousins that were he not allowed to move into it, he would, she also apprehended, be made to feel forlorn; and dreading lest his grandmother and his mother should be displeased at heart, she thought it imperative that he too should be permitted to take up his quarters inside, so that things should be put on a satisfactory footing; and directing the eunuch Hsia Chung to go to the Jung mansion and deliver her commands, she expressed the wish that Pao-ch'ai and the other girls should live in the garden and that it should not be kept closed, and urged that Pao-yü should also shift into it, at his own pleasure, for the prosecution of his studies. And Chia Cheng and madame Wang, upon receiving her commands, hastened, after the departure of Hsia Chung, to explain them to dowager lady Chia, and to despatch servants into the garden to tidy every place, to dust, to sweep, and to lay out the portieres and bed-curtains. The tidings were heard by the rest even with perfect equanimity, but Pao-yü was immoderately delighted; and he was engaged in deliberation with dowager lady Chia as to this necessary and to that requirement, when suddenly they descried a waiting-maid arrive, who announced: &quot;Master wishes to see Pao-yü.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü gazed vacantly for a while. His spirits simultaneously were swept away; his countenance changed colour; and clinging to old lady Chia, he readily wriggled her about, just as one would twist the sugar (to make sweetmeats with), and could not, for the very death of him, summon up courage to go; so that her ladyship had no alternative but to try and reassure him. &quot;My precious darling&quot; she urged, &quot;just you go, and I'll stand by you! He won't venture to be hard upon you; and besides, you've devised these excellent literary compositions; and I presume as Her Majesty has desired that you should move into the garden, his object is to give you a few words of advice; simply because he fears that you might be up to pranks in those grounds. But to all he tells you, whatever you do, mind you acquiesce and it will be all right!&quot;</p>
<p>And as she tried to compose him, she at the same time called two old nurses and enjoined them to take Pao-yü over with due care, &quot;And don't let his father,&quot; she added, &quot;frighten him!&quot;</p>
<p>The old nurses expressed their obedience, and Pao-yü felt constrained to walk ahead; and with one step scarcely progressing three inches, he leisurely came over to this side. Strange coincidence Chia Cheng was in madame Wang's apartments consulting with her upon some matter or other, and Chin Ch'uan-erh, Ts'ai Yun, Ts'ai Feng, Ts'ai Luan, Hsiu Feng and the whole number of waiting-maids were all standing outside under the verandah. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yü, they puckered up their mouths and laughed at him; while Chin Ch'uan grasped Pao-yü with one hand, and remarked in a low tone of voice: &quot;On these lips of mine has just been rubbed cosmetic, soaked with perfume, and are you now inclined to lick it or not?&quot; whereupon Ts'ai Yün pushed off Chin Ch'uan with one shove, as she interposed laughingly, &quot;A person's heart is at this moment in low spirits and do you still go on cracking jokes at him? But avail yourself of this opportunity when master is in good cheer to make haste and get in!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü had no help but to sidle against the door and walk in. Chia Cheng and madame Wang were, in fact, both in the inner rooms, and dame Chou raised the portière. Pao-yü stepped in gingerly and perceived Chia Cheng and madame Wang sitting opposite to each other, on the stove-couch, engaged in conversation; while below on a row of chairs sat Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and Chia Huan; but though all four of them were seated in there only T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and Chia Huan rose to their feet, as soon as they saw him make his appearance in the room; and when Chia Cheng raised his eyes and noticed Pao-yü standing in front of him, with a gait full of ease and with those winsome looks of his, so captivating, he once again realised what a mean being Chia Huan was, and how coarse his deportment. But suddenly he also bethought himself of Chia Chu, and as he reflected too that madame Wang had only this son of her own flesh and blood, upon whom she ever doated as upon a gem, and that his own beard had already begun to get hoary, the consequence was that he unwittingly stifled, well nigh entirely, the feeling of hatred and dislike, which, during the few recent years he had ordinarily fostered towards Pao-yü. And after a long pause, &quot;Her Majesty,&quot; he observed, &quot;bade you day after day ramble about outside to disport yourself, with the result that you gradually became remiss and lazy; but now her desire is that we should keep you under strict control, and that in prosecuting your studies in the company of your cousins in the garden, you should carefully exert your brains to learn; so that if you don't again attend to your duties, and mind your regular tasks, you had better be on your guard!&quot; Pao-yü assented several consecutive yes's; whereupon madame Wang drew him by her side and made him sit down, and while his three cousins resumed the seats they previously occupied: &quot;Have you finished all the pills you had been taking a short while back?&quot; madame Wang inquired, as she rubbed Pao-yü's neck.</p>
<p>&quot;There's still one pill remaining,&quot; Pao-yü explained by way of reply.</p>
<p>&quot;You had better,&quot; madame Wang added, &quot;fetch ten more pills tomorrow morning; and every day about bedtime tell Hsi Jen to give them to you; and when you've had one you can go to sleep!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ever since you, mother, bade me take them,&quot; Pao-yü rejoined, &quot;Hsi Jen has daily sent me one, when I was about to turn in.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who's this called Hsi Jen?&quot; Chia Chen thereupon ascertained.</p>
<p>&quot;She's a waiting-maid!&quot; madame Wang answered.</p>
<p>&quot;A servant girl,&quot; Chia Cheng remonstrated, &quot;can be called by whatever name one chooses; anything is good enough; but who's it who has started this kind of pretentious name!&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Wang noticed that Chia Cheng was not in a happy frame of mind, so that she forthwith tried to screen matters for Pao-yü, by saying: &quot;It's our old lady who has originated it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can it possibly be,&quot; Chia Cheng exclaimed, &quot;that her ladyship knows anything about such kind of language? It must, for a certainty, be Pao-yü!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü perceiving that he could not conceal the truth from him, was under the necessity of standing up and of explaining; &quot;As I have all along read verses, I remembered the line written by an old poet:</p>
<p> &quot;What time the smell of flowers wafts itself into man, one knows the<br>
      day is warm.\</p>
<p>&quot;And as this waiting-maid's surname was Hua (flower), I readily gave her the name, on the strength of this sentiment.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When you get back,&quot; madame Wang speedily suggested addressing Pao-yü, &quot;change it and have done; and you, sir, needn't lose your temper over such a trivial matter!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't really matter in the least,&quot; Chia Cheng continued; &quot;so that there's no necessity of changing it; but it's evident that Pao-yü doesn't apply his mind to legitimate pursuits, but mainly devotes his energies to such voluptuous expressions and wanton verses!&quot; And as he finished these words, he abruptly shouted out: &quot;You brute-like child of retribution! Don't you yet get out of this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Get away, off with you!&quot; madame Wang in like manner hastened to urge; &quot;our dowager lady is waiting, I fear, for you to have her repast!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü assented, and, with gentle step, he withdrew out of the room, laughing at Chin Ch'uan-erh, as he put out his tongue; and leading off the two nurses, he went off on his way like a streak of smoke. But no sooner had he reached the door of the corridor than he espied Hsi Jen standing leaning against the side; who perceiving Pao-yü come back safe and sound heaped smile upon smile, and asked: &quot;What did he want you for?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There was nothing much,&quot; Pao-yü explained, &quot;he simply feared that I would, when I get into the garden, be up to mischief, and he gave me all sorts of advice;&quot; and, as while he explained matters, they came into the presence of lady Chia, he gave her a clear account, from first to last, of what had transpired. But when he saw that Lin Tai-yü was at the moment in the room, Pao-yü speedily inquired of her: &quot;Which place do you think best to live in?&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü had just been cogitating on this subject, so that when she unexpectedly heard Pao-yü's inquiry, she forthwith rejoined with a smile: &quot;My own idea is that the Hsio Hsiang Kuan is best; for I'm fond of those clusters of bamboos, which hide from view the tortuous balustrade and make the place more secluded and peaceful than any other!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü at these words clapped his hands and smiled. &quot;That just meets with my own views!&quot; he remarked; &quot;I too would like you to go and live in there; and as I am to stay in the I Hung Yuan, we two will be, in the first place, near each other; and next, both in quiet and secluded spots.&quot;</p>
<p>While the two of them were conversing, a servant came, sent over by Chia Cheng, to report to dowager lady Chia that: &quot;The 22nd of the second moon was a propitious day for Pao-yü and the young ladies to shift their quarters into the garden; that during these few days, servants should be sent in to put things in their proper places and to clean; that Hsueh Pao-ch'ai should put up in the Heng Wu court; that Lin Tai-yü was to live in the Hsiao Hsiang lodge; that Chia Ying-ch'un should move into the Cho Chin two-storied building; that T'an Ch'un should put up in the Ch'iu Yen library; that Hsi Ch'un should take up her quarters in the Liao Feng house; that widow Li should live in the Tao Hsiang village, and that Pao-yü was to live in the I Hung court. That at every place two old nurses should be added and four servant-girls; that exclusive of the nurse and personal waiting-maid of each, there should, in addition, be servants, whose special duties should be to put things straight and to sweep the place; and that on the 22nd, they should all, in a body, move into the garden.&quot;</p>
<p>When this season drew near, the interior of the grounds, with the flowers waving like embroidered sashes, and the willows fanned by the fragrant breeze, was no more as desolate and silent as it had been in previous days; but without indulging in any further irrelevant details, we shall now go back to Pao-yü.</p>
<p>Ever since he shifted his quarters into the park, his heart was full of joy, and his mind of contentment, fostering none of those extraordinary ideas, whose tendency could be to give birth to longings and hankerings. Day after day, he simply indulged, in the company of his female cousins and the waiting-maids, in either reading his books, or writing characters, or in thrumming the lute, playing chess, drawing pictures and scanning verses, even in drawing patterns of argus pheasants, in embroidering phoenixes, contesting with them in searching for strange plants, and gathering flowers, in humming poetry with gentle tone, singing ballads with soft voice, dissecting characters, and in playing at mora, so that, being free to go everywhere and anywhere, he was of course completely happy. From his pen emanate four ballads on the times of the four seasons, which, although they could not be looked upon as first-rate, afford anyhow a correct idea of his sentiments, and a true account of the scenery.</p>
<p>The ballad on the spring night runs as follows:</p>
<p>  The silken curtains, thin as russet silk, at random are spread out.<br>
  The croak of frogs from the adjoining lane but faintly strikes the<br>
      ear.<br>
  The pillow a slight chill pervades, for rain outside the window falls.<br>
  The landscape, which now meets the eye, is like that seen in dreams by<br>
      man.<br>
  In plenteous streams the candles' tears do drop, but for whom do they<br>
      weep?<br>
  Each particle of grief felt by the flowers is due to anger against me.<br>
  It's all because the maids have by indulgence indolent been made.<br>
  The cover over me I'll pull, as I am loth to laugh and talk for long.\</p>
<p>This is the description of the aspect of nature on a summer night:</p>
<p>  The beauteous girl, weary of needlework, quiet is plunged in a long<br>
      dream.<br>
  The parrot in the golden cage doth shout that it is time the tea to<br>
      brew.<br>
  The lustrous windows with the musky moon like open palace-mirrors<br>
      look;<br>
  The room abounds with fumes of sandalwood and all kinds of imperial<br>
      scents.<br>
  From the cups made of amber is poured out the slippery dew from the<br>
      lotus.<br>
  The banisters of glass, the cool zephyr enjoy flapped by the willow<br>
      trees.<br>
  In the stream-spanning kiosk, the curtains everywhere all at one time<br>
      do wave.<br>
  In the vermilion tower the blinds the maidens roll, for they have made<br>
      the night's toilette.\</p>
<p>The landscape of an autumnal evening is thus depicted:</p>
<p>  In the interior of the Chiang Yün house are hushed all clamorous din<br>
      and noise.<br>
  The sheen, which from Selene flows, pervades the windows of carnation<br>
      gauze.<br>
  The moss-locked, streaked rocks shelter afford to the cranes, plunged<br>
      in sleep.<br>
  The dew, blown on the t'ung tree by the well, doth wet the roosting<br>
      rooks.<br>
  Wrapped in a quilt, the maid comes the gold phoenix coverlet to<br>
      spread.<br>
  The girl, who on the rails did lean, on her return drops the<br>
      kingfisher flowers!<br>
  This quiet night his eyes in sleep he cannot close, as he doth long<br>
      for wine.<br>
  The smoke is stifled, and the fire restirred, when tea is ordered to<br>
      be brewed.\</p>
<p>The picture of a winter night is in this strain:</p>
<p>  The sleep of the plum trees, the dream of the bamboos the third watch<br>
      have already reached.<br>
  Under the embroidered quilt and the kingfisher coverlet one can't<br>
      sleep for the cold.<br>
  The shadow of fir trees pervades the court, but cranes are all that<br>
      meet the eye.<br>
  Both far and wide the pear blossom covers the ground, but yet the hawk<br>
      cannot be heard.<br>
  The wish, verses to write, fostered by the damsel with the green<br>
      sleeves, has waxéd cold.<br>
  The master, with the gold sable pelisse, cannot endure much wine.<br>
  But yet he doth rejoice that his attendant knows the way to brew the<br>
      tea.<br>
  The newly-fallen snow is swept what time for tea the water must be<br>
      boiled.\</p>
<p>But putting aside Pao-yü, as he leisurely was occupied in scanning some verses, we will now allude to all these ballads. There lived, at that time, a class of people, whose wont was to servilely court the influential and wealthy, and who, upon perceiving that the verses were composed by a young lad of the Jung Kuo mansion, of only twelve or thirteen years of age, had copies made, and taking them outside sang their praise far and wide. There were besides another sort of light-headed young men, whose heart was so set upon licentious and seductive lines, that they even inscribed them on fans and screen-walls, and time and again kept on humming them and extolling them. And to the above reasons must therefore be ascribed the fact that persons came in search of stanzas and in quest of manuscripts, to apply for sketches and to beg for poetical compositions, to the increasing satisfaction of Pao-yü, who day after day, when at home, devoted his time and attention to these extraneous matters. But who would have anticipated that he could ever in his quiet seclusion have become a prey to a spirit of restlessness? Of a sudden, one day he began to feel discontent, finding fault with this and turning up his nose at that; and going in and coming out he was simply full of ennui. And as all the girls in the garden were just in the prime of youth, and at a time of life when, artless and unaffected, they sat and reclined without regard to retirement, and disported themselves and joked without heed, how could they ever have come to read the secrets which at this time occupied a place in the heart of Pao-yü? But so unhappy was Pao-yü within himself that he soon felt loth to stay in the garden, and took to gadding about outside like an evil spirit; but he behaved also the while in an idiotic manner.</p>
<p>Ming Yen, upon seeing him go on in this way, felt prompted, with the idea of affording his mind some distraction, to think of this and to devise that expedient; but everything had been indulged in with surfeit by Pao-yü, and there was only this resource, (that suggested itself to him,) of which Pao-yü had not as yet had any experience. Bringing his reflections to a close, he forthwith came over to a bookshop, and selecting novels, both of old and of the present age, traditions intended for outside circulation on Fei Yen, Ho Te, Wu Tse-t'ien, and Yang Kuei-fei, as well as books of light literature consisting of strange legends, he purchased a good number of them with the express purpose of enticing Pao-yü to read them. As soon as Pao-yü caught sight of them, he felt as if he had obtained some gem or jewel. &quot;But you mustn't,&quot; Ming Yen went on to enjoin him, &quot;take them into the garden; for if any one were to come to know anything about them, I shall then suffer more than I can bear; and you should, when you go along, hide them in your clothes!&quot;</p>
<p>But would Pao-yü agree to not introducing them into the garden? So after much wavering, he picked out only several volumes of those whose style was more refined, and took them in, and threw them over the top of his bed for him to peruse when no one was present; while those coarse and very indecent ones, he concealed in a bundle in the outer library.</p>
<p>On one day, which happened to be the middle decade of the third moon, Pao-yü, after breakfast, took a book, the &quot;Hui Chen Chi,&quot; in his hand and walked as far as the bridge of the Hsin Fang lock. Seating himself on a block of rock, that lay under the peach trees in that quarter, he opened the Hui Chen Chi and began to read it carefully from the beginning. But just as he came to the passage: &quot;the falling red (flowers) have formed a heap,&quot; he felt a gust of wind blow through the trees, bringing down a whole bushel of peach blossoms; and, as they fell, his whole person, the entire surface of the book as well as a large extent of ground were simply bestrewn with petals of the blossoms. Pao-yü was bent upon shaking them down; but as he feared lest they should be trodden under foot, he felt constrained to carry the petals in his coat and walk to the bank of the pond and throw them into the stream. The petals floated on the surface of the water, and, after whirling and swaying here and there, they at length ran out by the Hsin Fang lock. But, on his return under the tree, he found the ground again one mass of petals, and Pao-yü was just hesitating what to do, when he heard some one behind his back inquire, &quot;What are you up to here?&quot; and as soon as Pao-yü turned his head round, he discovered that it was Lin Tai-yü, who had come over carrying on her shoulder a hoe for raking flowers, that on this hoe was suspended a gauze-bag, and that in her hand she held a broom.</p>
<p>&quot;That's right, well done!&quot; Pao-yü remarked smiling; &quot;come and sweep these flowers, and throw them into the water yonder. I've just thrown a lot in there myself!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It isn't right,&quot; Lin Tai-yü rejoined, &quot;to throw them into the water. The water, which you see, is clean enough here, but as soon as it finds its way out, where are situated other people's grounds, what isn't there in it? so that you would be misusing these flowers just as much as if you left them here! But in that corner, I have dug a hole for flowers, and I'll now sweep these and put them into this gauze-bag and bury them in there; and, in course of many days, they will also become converted into earth, and won't this be a clean way (of disposing of them)?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü, after listening to these words, felt inexpressibly delighted. &quot;Wait!&quot; he smiled, &quot;until I put down my book, and I'll help you to clear them up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the book?&quot; Tai-yü inquired.</p>
<p>Pao-yü at this question was so taken aback that he had no time to conceal it. &quot;It's,&quot; he replied hastily, &quot;the Chung Yung and the Ta Hsüeh!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you going again to play the fool with me? Be quick and give it to me to see; and this will be ever so much better a way!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Cousin,&quot; Pao-yü replied, &quot;as far as you yourself are concerned I don't mind you, but after you've seen it, please don't tell any one else. It's really written in beautiful style; and were you to once begin reading it, why even for your very rice you wouldn't have a thought?&quot;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he handed it to her; and Tai-yü deposited all the flowers on the ground, took over the book, and read it from the very first page; and the more she perused it, she got so much the more fascinated by it, that in no time she had finished reading sixteen whole chapters. But aroused as she was to a state of rapture by the diction, what remained even of the fascination was enough to overpower her senses; and though she had finished reading, she nevertheless continued in a state of abstraction, and still kept on gently recalling the text to mind, and humming it to herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Cousin, tell me is it nice or not?&quot; Pao-yü grinned.</p>
<p>&quot;It is indeed full of zest!&quot; Lin Tai-yü replied exultingly.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm that very sad and very sickly person,&quot; Pao-yü explained laughing, &quot;while you are that beauty who could subvert the empire and overthrow the city.&quot;</p>
<p>Lin Tai-yü became, at these words, unconsciously crimson all over her cheeks, even up to her very ears; and raising, at the same moment, her two eyebrows, which seemed to knit and yet not to knit, and opening wide those eyes, which seemed to stare and yet not to stare, while her peach-like cheeks bore an angry look and on her thin-skinned face lurked displeasure, she pointed at Pao-yü and exclaimed: &quot;You do deserve death, for the rubbish you talk! without any provocation you bring up these licentious expressions and wanton ballads to give vent to all this insolent rot, in order to insult me; but I'll go and tell uncle and aunt.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as she pronounced the two words &quot;insult me,&quot; her eyeballs at once were suffused with purple, and turning herself round she there and then walked away; which filled Pao-yü with so much distress that he jumped forward to impede her progress, as he pleaded: &quot;My dear cousin, I earnestly entreat you to spare me this time! I've indeed said what I shouldn't; but if I had any intention to insult you, I'll throw myself to-morrow into the pond, and let the scabby-headed turtle eat me up, so that I become transformed into a large tortoise. And when you shall have by and by become the consort of an officer of the first degree, and you shall have fallen ill from old age and returned to the west, I'll come to your tomb and bear your stone tablet for ever on my back!&quot;</p>
<p>As he uttered these words, Lin Tai-yü burst out laughing with a sound of &quot;pu ch'ih,&quot; and rubbing her eyes, she sneeringly remarked: &quot;I too can come out with this same tune; but will you now still go on talking nonsense? Pshaw! you're, in very truth, like a spear-head, (which looks) like silver, (but is really soft as) wax!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go on, go on!&quot; Pao-yü smiled after this remark; &quot;and what you've said,<br>
I too will go and tell!&quot;\</p>
<p>&quot;You maintain,&quot; Lin Tai-yü rejoined sarcastically, &quot;that after glancing at anything you're able to recite it; and do you mean to say that I can't even do so much as take in ten lines with one gaze?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü smiled and put his book away, urging: &quot;Let's do what's right and proper, and at once take the flowers and bury them; and don't let us allude to these things!&quot;</p>
<p>Forthwith the two of them gathered the fallen blossoms; but no sooner had they interred them properly than they espied Hsi Jen coming, who went on to observe: &quot;Where haven't I looked for you? What! have you found your way as far as this! But our senior master, Mr. Chia She, over there isn't well; and the young ladies have all gone over to pay their respects, and our old lady has asked that you should be sent over; so go back at once and change your clothes!&quot;</p>
<p>When Pao-yü heard what she said, he hastily picked up his books, and saying good bye to Tai-yü, he came along with Hsi Jen, back into his room, where we will leave him to effect the necessary change in his costume. But during this while, Lin Tai-yü was, after having seen Pao-yü walk away, and heard that all her cousins were likewise not in their rooms, wending her way back alone, in a dull and dejected mood, towards her apartment, when upon reaching the outside corner of the wall of the Pear Fragrance court, she caught, issuing from inside the walls, the harmonious strains of the fife and the melodious modulations of voices singing. Lin Tai-yü readily knew that it was the twelve singing-girls rehearsing a play; and though she did not give her mind to go and listen, yet a couple of lines were of a sudden blown into her ears, and with such clearness, that even one word did not escape. Their burden was this:</p>
<p>  These troth are beauteous purple and fine carmine flowers, which in<br>
      this way all round do bloom,<br>
  And all together lie ensconced along the broken well, and the<br>
      dilapidated wall!\</p>
<p>But the moment Lin Tai-yü heard these lines, she was, in fact, so intensely affected and agitated that she at once halted and lending an ear listened attentively to what they went on to sing, which ran thus:</p>
<p>  A glorious day this is, and pretty scene, but sad I feel at heart!<br>
  Contentment and pleasure are to be found in whose family courts?\</p>
<p>After overhearing these two lines, she unconsciously nodded her head, and sighed, and mused in her own mind. &quot;Really,&quot; she thought, &quot;there is fine diction even in plays! but unfortunately what men in this world simply know is to see a play, and they don't seem to be able to enjoy the beauties contained in them.&quot;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this train of thought, she experienced again a sting of regret, (as she fancied) she should not have given way to such idle thoughts and missed attending to the ballads; but when she once more came to listen, the song, by some coincidence, went on thus:</p>
<p>  It's all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely<br>
      spring,<br>
  That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream.\</p>
<p>When this couplet struck Tai-yu's ear, her heart felt suddenly a prey to excitement and her soul to emotion; and upon further hearing the words:</p>
<p>  Alone you sit in the secluded inner rooms to self-compassion giving<br>
      way.\</p>
<p>&mdash;and other such lines, she became still more as if inebriated, and like as if out of her head, and unable to stand on her feet, she speedily stooped her body, and, taking a seat on a block of stone, she minutely pondered over the rich beauty of the eight characters:</p>
<p>  It's all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely<br>
      spring,<br>
  That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream.\</p>
<p>Of a sudden, she likewise bethought herself of the line:</p>
<p>Water flows away and flowers decay, for both no feelings have.</p>
<p>&mdash;which she had read some days back in a poem of an ancient writer, and also of the passage:</p>
<p>  When on the running stream the flowers do fall, spring then is past<br>
      and gone;\</p>
<p>&mdash;and of:</p>
<p>Heaven (differs from) the human race,</p>
<p>&mdash;which also appeared in that work; and besides these, the lines, which she had a short while back read in the Hsi Hiang Chi:</p>
<p>  The flowers, lo, fall, and on their course the waters red do flow!<br>
  Petty misfortunes of ten thousand kinds (my heart assail!)\</p>
<p>both simultaneously flashed through her memory; and, collating them all together, she meditated on them minutely, until suddenly her heart was stricken with pain and her soul fleeted away, while from her eyes trickled down drops of tears. But while nothing could dispel her present state of mind, she unexpectedly realised that some one from behind gave her a tap; and, turning her head round to look, she found that it was a young girl; but who it was, the next chapter will make known.</p>

<p>  The drunken Chin Kang makes light of lucre and shows a preference for<br>
      generosity.<br>
  The foolish girl mislays her handkerchief and arouses mutual thoughts.\</p>
<p>But to return to our narrative. Lin Tai-yü's sentimental reflections were the while reeling and ravelling in an intricate maze, when unexpectedly some one from behind gave her a tap, saying: &quot;What are you up to all alone here?&quot; which took Lin Tai-yu so much by surprise that she gave a start, and turning her head round to look and noticing that it was Hsiang Ling and no one else; &quot;You stupid girl!&quot; Lin Tai-yü replied, &quot;you've given me such a fright! But where do you come from at this time?&quot;</p>
<p>Hsiang Ling giggled and smirked. &quot;I've come,&quot; she added, &quot;in search of our young lady, but I can't find her anywhere. But your Tzu Chuan is also looking after you; and she says that lady Secunda has sent a present to you of some tea. But you had better go back home and sit down.&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, she took Tai-yü by the hand, and they came along back to the Hsiao Hsiang Kuan; where lady Feng had indeed sent her two small catties of a new season tea, of superior quality. But Lin Tai-yü sat down, in company with Hsiang Ling, and began to converse on the merits of this tapestry and the fineness of that embroidery; and after they had also had a game at chess, and read a few sentences out of a book, Hsiang Ling took her departure. But we need not speak of either of them, but return now to Pao-yü. Having been found, and brought back home, by Hsi Jen, he discovered Yuan Yang reclining on the bed, in the act of examining Hsi Jen's needlework; but when she perceived Pao-yü arrive, she forthwith remarked: &quot;Where have you been? her venerable ladyship is waiting for you to tell you to go over and pay your obeisance to our Senior master, and don't you still make haste to go and change your clothes and be off!&quot;</p>
<p>Hsi Jen at once walked into the room to fetch his clothes, and Pao-yü sat on the edge of the bed, and pushed his shoes off with his toes; and, while waiting for his boots to put them on, he turned round and perceiving that Yüan Yang, who was clad in a light red silk jacket and a green satin waistcoat, and girdled with a white crepe sash, had her face turned the other way, and her head lowered giving her attention to the criticism of the needlework, while round her neck she wore a collar with embroidery, Pao-yü readily pressed his face against the nape of her neck, and as he sniffed the perfume about it, he did not stay his hand from stroking her neck, which in whiteness and smoothness was not below that of Hsi Jen; and as he approached her, &quot;My dear girl,&quot; he said smiling and with a drivelling face, &quot;do let me lick the cosmetic off your mouth!&quot; clinging to her person, as he uttered these words, like twisted sweetmeat.</p>
<p>&quot;Hsi Jen!&quot; cried Yüan Yang at once, &quot;come out and see! You've been with him a whole lifetime, and don't you give him any advice; but let him still behave in this fashion!&quot; Whereupon, Hsi Jen walked out, clasping the clothes, and turning to Pao-yü, she observed, &quot;I advise you in this way and it's no good, I advise you in that way and you don't mend; and what do you mean to do after all? But if you again behave like this, it will then, in fact, be impossible for me to live any longer in this place!&quot;</p>
<p>As she tendered these words of counsel, she urged him to put his clothes on, and, after he had changed, he betook himself, along with Yuan Yang, to the front part of the mansion, and bade good-bye to dowager lady Chia; after which he went outside, where the attendants and horses were all in readiness; but when he was about to mount his steed, he perceived Chia Lien back from his visit and in the act of dismounting; and as the two of them stood face to face, and mutually exchanged some inquiries, they saw some one come round from the side, and say: &quot;My respects to you, uncle Pao-yü!&quot;</p>
<p>When Pao-yü came to look at him, he noticed that this person had an oblong face, that his body was tall and lanky, that his age was only eighteen or nineteen, and that he possessed, in real truth, an air of refinement and elegance; but though his features were, after all, exceedingly familiar, he could not recall to mind to what branch of the family he belonged, and what his name was.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you staring vacantly for?&quot; Chia Lien inquired laughing.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't you even recognise him? He's Yün Erh, the son of our fifth sister-in-law, who lives in the back court!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course!&quot; Pao-yü assented complacently. &quot;How is it that I had forgotten just now!&quot; And having gone on to ask how his mother was, and what work he had to do at present; &quot;I've come in search of uncle Secundus, to tell him something,&quot; Chia Yün replied, as he pointed at Chia Lien.</p>
<p>&quot;You've really improved vastly from what you were before,&quot; added Pao-yü smiling; &quot;you verily look just is if you were my son!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How very barefaced!&quot; Chia Lien exclaimed as he burst out laughing; &quot;here's a person four or five years your senior to be made your son!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How far are you in your teens this year?&quot; Pao-yü inquired with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Eighteen!&quot; Chia Yün rejoined.</p>
<p>This Chia Yün was, in real deed, sharp and quick-witted; and when he heard Pao-yü remark that he looked like his son, he readily gave a sarcastic smile and observed, &quot;The proverb is true which says, 'the grandfather is rocked in the cradle while the grandson leans on a staff.' But though old enough in years, I'm nevertheless like a mountain, which, in spite of its height, cannot screen the sun from view. Besides, since my father's death, I've had no one to look after me, and were you, uncle Pao, not to disdain your doltish nephew, and to acknowledge me as your son, it would be your nephew's good fortune!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you heard what he said?&quot; Chia Lien interposed cynically. &quot;But to acknowledge him as a son is no easy question to settle!&quot; and with these words, he walked in; whereupon Pao-yü smilingly said: &quot;To-morrow when you have nothing to do, just come and look me up; but don't go and play any devilish pranks with them! I've just now no leisure, so come to-morrow, into the library, where I'll have a chat with you for a whole day, and take you into the garden for some fun!&quot;</p>
<p>With this remark still on his lips, he laid hold of the saddle and mounted his horse; and, followed by the whole bevy of pages, he crossed over to Chia She's on this side; where having discovered that Chia She had nothing more the matter with him than a chill which he had suddenly contracted, he commenced by delivering dowager lady Chia's message, and next paid his own obeisance. Chia She, at first, stood up and made suitable answer to her venerable ladyship's inquiries, and then calling a servant, &quot;Take the gentleman,&quot; he said, &quot;into my lady's apartment to sit down.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü withdrew out of the room, and came by the back to the upper apartment; and as soon as madame Hsing caught sight of him, she, before everything else, rose to her feet and asked after old lady Chia's health; after which, Pao-yü made his own salutation, and madame Hsing drew him on to the stove-couch, where she induced him to take a seat, and eventually inquired after the other inmates, and also gave orders to serve the tea. But scarcely had they had tea, before they perceived Chia Tsung come in to pay his respects to Pao-yü.</p>
<p>&quot;Where could one find such a living monkey as this!&quot; madame Hsing remarked; &quot;is that nurse of yours dead and gone that she doesn't even keep you clean and tidy, and that she lets you go about with those eyebrows of yours so black and that mouth so filthy! you scarcely look like the child of a great family of scholars.&quot;</p>
<p>While she spoke, she perceived both Chia Huan and Chia Lan, one of whom was a young uncle and the other his nephew, also advance and present their compliments, and madame Hsing bade the two of them sit down on the chairs. But when Chia Huan noticed that Pao-yü sat on the same rug with madame Hsing, and that her ladyship was further caressing and petting him in every possible manner, he soon felt so very unhappy at heart, that, after sitting for a short time, he forthwith made a sign to Chia Lan that he would like to go; and as Chia Lan could not but humour him, they both got up together to take their leave. But when Pao-yü perceived them rise, he too felt a wish to go back along with them, but madame Hsing remarked smilingly, &quot;You had better sit a while as I've something more to tell you,&quot; so that Pao-yü had no alternative but to stay. &quot;When you get back,&quot; madame Hsing added, addressing the other two, &quot;present, each one of you, my regards to your respective mothers. The young ladies, your cousins, are all here making such a row that my head is dazed, so that I won't to-day keep you to have your repast here.&quot; To which Chia Huan and Chia Lan assented and quickly walked out.</p>
<p>&quot;If it be really the case that all my cousins have come over,&quot; Pao-yü ventured with a smirk, &quot;how is it that I don't see them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;After sitting here for a while,&quot; madame Hsing explained, &quot;they all went at the back; but in what rooms they have gone, I don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My senior aunt, you said you had something to tell me, Pao-yü observed; what's it, I wonder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What can there possibly be to tell you?&quot; madame Hsing laughed; &quot;it was simply to make you wait and have your repast with the young ladies and then go; but there's also a fine plaything that I'll give you to take back to amuse yourself with.&quot;</p>
<p>These two, the aunt and her nephew, were going on with their colloquy when, much to their surprise, it was time for dinner and the young ladies were all invited to come. The tables and chairs were put in their places, and the cups and plates were arranged in proper order; and, after the mother, her daughter and the cousins had finished their meal, Pao-yü bade good-bye to Chia She and returned home in company with all the young ladies; and when they had said good-night to dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and the others, they each went back into their rooms and retired to rest; where we shall leave them without any further comment and speak of Chia Yün's visit to the mansion. As soon as he saw Chia Lien, he inquired what business it was that had turned up, and Chia Lien consequently explained: &quot;The other day something did actually present itself, but as it happened that your aunt had again and again entreated me, I gave it to Chia Ch'in; as she promised me that there would be by and by in the garden several other spots where flowers and trees would be planted; and that when this job did occur, she would, for a certainty, give it to you and finish!&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Yün, upon hearing these words, suggested after a short pause; &quot;If that be so, there's nothing for me to do than to wait; but, uncle, you too mustn't make any allusion beforehand in the presence of aunt to my having come to-day to make any inquiries; for there will really be ample time to speak to her when the job turns up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why should I allude to it?&quot; Chia Lien rejoined. &quot;Have I forsooth got all this leisure to talk of irrelevant matters! But to-morrow, besides, I've got to go as far as Hsing Yi for a turn, and it's absolutely necessary that I should hurriedly come back the very same day; so off with you now and go and wait; and the day after to-morrow, after the watch has been set, come and ask for news; but mind at any earlier hour, I shan't have any leisure!&quot; With these words, he hastily went at the back to change his clothes. And from the time Chia Yun put his foot out of the door of the Jung Kuo mansion, he was, the whole way homeward, plunged in deep thought; but having bethought himself of some expedient, he straightway wended his steps towards the house of his maternal uncle, Pu Shih-jen. This Pu Shih-jen, it must be explained, kept, at the present date, a shop for the sale of spices. He had just returned home from his shop, and as soon as he noticed Chia Yun, he inquired of him what business brought him there.</p>
<p>&quot;There's something,&quot; Chia Yun replied, &quot;in which I would like to crave your assistance, uncle; I'm in need of some baroos camphor and musk, so please, uncle, give me on credit four ounces of each kind, and on the festival of the eighth moon, I'll bring you the amount in full.&quot;</p>
<p>Pu Shih-jen gave a sardonic smile. &quot;Don't,&quot; he said, &quot;again allude to any such thing as selling on tick! Some time back a partner in our establishment got several ounces of goods for his relatives on credit, and up to this date the bill hasn't as yet been settled; the result being that we've all had to make the amount good, so that we've entered into an agreement that we should no more allow any one to obtain on tick anything on behalf of either relative or friend, and that whoever acted contrary to this resolution should be, at once, fined twenty taels, with which to stand a treat. Besides, the stock of these articles is now short, and were you also to come, with ready money to this our mean shop to buy any, we wouldn't even have as much to give you. The best way therefore is for you to go elsewhere. This is one side of the question; for on the other, you can't have anything above-board in view; and were you to obtain what you want as a loan you would again go and play the giddy dog! But you'll simply say that on every occasion your uncle sees you, he avails himself of it to find fault with you, but a young fellow like you doesn't know what's good and what is bad; and you should, besides, make up your mind to earn a few cash, wherewith to clothe and feed yourself, so that, when I see you, I too may rejoice!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What you, uncle, say,&quot; Chia Yun rejoined smiling, &quot;is perfectly right; the only thing is that at the time of my father's death, I was likewise so young in years that I couldn't understand anything; but later on, I heard my mother explain how that for everything, it was lucky that you, after all, my uncles, went over to our house and devised the ways and means, and managed the funeral; and is it likely you, uncle, aren't aware of these things? Besides, have I forsooth had a single acre of land or a couple of houses, the value of which I've run through as soon as it came into my hands? An ingenious wife cannot make boiled rice without raw rice; and what would you have me do? It's your good fortune however that you've got to deal with one such as I am, for had it been any one else barefaced and shameless, he would have come, twice every three days, to worry you, uncle, by asking for two pints of rice and two of beans, and you then, uncle, would have had no help for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear child,&quot; Pu Shih-jen exclaimed, &quot;had I anything that I could call my own, your uncle as I am, wouldn't I feel bound to do something for you? I've day after day mentioned to your aunt that the misfortune was that you had no resources. But should you ever succeed in making up your mind, you should go into that mighty household of yours, and when the gentlemen aren't looking, forthwith pocket your pride and hobnob with those managers, or possibly with the butlers, as you may, even through them, be able to get some charge or other! The other day, when I was out of town, I came across that old Quartus of the third branch of the family, astride of a tall donkey, at the head of four or five carriages, in which were about forty to fifty bonzes and Taoist priests on their way to the family fane, and that man can't lack brains, for such a charge to have fallen to his share!&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Yün, upon hearing these words, indulged in a long and revolting rigmarole, and then got up to take his leave.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you in such a hurry for?&quot; Pu Shih-jen remarked. &quot;Have your meal and then go!&quot;</p>
<p>But this remark was scarcely ended when they heard his wife say: &quot;Are you again in the clouds? When I heard that there was no rice, I bought half a catty of dry rice paste, and brought it here for you to eat; and do you pray now still put on the airs of a well-to-do, and keep your nephew to feel the pangs of hunger?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, buy half a catty more, and add to what there is, that's all,&quot; Pu Shih-jen continued; whereupon her mother explained to her daughter, Yin Chieh, &quot;Go over to Mrs. Wang's opposite, and ask her if she has any cash, to lend us twenty or thirty of them; and to-morrow, when they're brought over, we'll repay her.&quot;</p>
<p>But while the husband and wife were carrying on this conversation, Chia Yün had, at an early period, repeated several times: &quot;There's no need to go to this trouble,&quot; and off he went, leaving no trace or shadow behind. But without passing any further remarks on the husband and wife of the Pu family, we will now confine ourselves to Chia Yün. Having gone in high dudgeon out of the door of his uncle's house, he started straight on his way back home; but while distressed in mind, and preoccupied with his thoughts, he paced on with drooping head, he unexpectedly came into collision with a drunken fellow, who gripped Chia Yün, and began to abuse him, crying: &quot;Are your eyes gone blind, that you come bang against me?&quot;</p>
<p>The tone of voice, when it reached Chia Yün ears, sounded like that of some one with whom he was intimate; and, on careful scrutiny, he found, in fact, that it was his next-door neighbour, Ni Erh. This Ni Erh was a dissolute knave, whose only idea was to give out money at heavy rates of interest and to have his meals in the gambling dens. His sole delight was to drink and to fight.</p>
<p>He was, at this very moment, coming back home from the house of a creditor, whom he had dunned, and was already far gone with drink, so that when, at an unforeseen moment, Chia Yün ran against him, he meant there and then to start a scuffle with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Old Erh!&quot; Chia Yün shouted, &quot;stay your hand; it's I who have hustled against you.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Ni Erh heard the tone of his voice, he opened wide his drunken eyes and gave him a look; and realising that it was Chia Yün, he hastened to loosen his grasp and to remark with a smile, as he staggered about, &quot;Is it you indeed, master Chia Secundus? where were you off to now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't tell you!&quot; Chia Yün rejoined; &quot;I've again brought displeasure upon me, and all through no fault of mine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind!&quot; urged Ni Erh, &quot;if you're in any trouble you just tell me, and I'll give vent to your spite for you; for in these three streets, and six lanes, no matter who may give offence to any neighbours of mine, of me, Ni Erh, the drunken Chin Kang, I'll wager that I compel that man's family to disperse, and his home to break up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Old Ni, don't lose your temper,&quot; Chia Yün protested, &quot;but listen and let me tell you what happened!&quot; After which, he went on to tell Ni Erh the whole affair with Pu Shih-jen. As soon as Ni Erh heard him, he got into a frightful rage; &quot;Were he not,&quot; he shouted, a &quot;relative of yours, master Secundus, I would readily give him a bit of my mind! Really resentment will stifle my breath! but never mind! you needn't however distress yourself. I've got here a few taels ready at hand, which, if you require, don't scruple to take; and from such good neighbours as you are, I won't ask any interest upon this money.&quot;</p>
<p>With this remark still on his lips, he produced from his pouch a bundle of silver.</p>
<p>&quot;Ni Erh has, it is true, ever been a rogue,&quot; Chia Yün reflected in his own mind, &quot;but as he is regulated in his dealings by a due regard to persons, he enjoys, to a great degree, the reputation of generosity; and were I to-day not to accept this favour of his, he'll, I fear, be put to shame; and it won't contrariwise be nice on my part! and isn't it better that I should make use of his money, and by and by I can repay him double, and things will be all right!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Old Erh,&quot; he therefore observed aloud with a smile, &quot;you're really a fine fellow, and as you've shown me such eminent consideration, how can I presume not to accept your offer! On my return home, I'll write the customary I.O.U., and send it to you, and all will be in order.&quot;</p>
