    <h1>3</h1>
    <p>After this followed a picture of several streaks of fleeting clouds, and of a creek whose waters were exhausted, with the text:</p>
<p>  Riches and honours too what benefit are they?<br>
  In swaddling clothes thou'lt be when parents pass away;<br>
  The rays will slant, quick as the twinkle of an eye;<br>
  The Hsiang stream will recede, the Ch'u clouds onward fly!\</p>
<p>Then came a picture of a beautiful gem, which had fallen into the mire, with the verse:</p>
<p>  Thine aim is chastity, but chaste thou wilt not be;<br>
  Abstraction is thy faith, but void thou may'st not see;<br>
  Thy precious, gemlike self will, pitiful to say,<br>
  Into the mundane mire collapse at length some day.\</p>
<p>A rough sketch followed of a savage wolf, in pursuit of a beautiful girl, trying to pounce upon her as he wished to devour her. This was the burden of the distich:</p>
<p>  Thy mate is like a savage wolf prowling among the hills;<br>
  His wish once gratified a haughty spirit his heart fills!<br>
  Though fair thy form like flowers or willows in the golden moon,<br>
  Upon the yellow beam to hang will shortly be its doom.\</p>
<p>Below, was an old temple, in the interior of which was a beautiful person, just in the act of reading the religious manuals, as she sat all alone; with this inscription:</p>
<p>  In light esteem thou hold'st the charms of the three springs for their<br>
      short-liv'd fate;<br>
  Thine attire of past years to lay aside thou chang'st, a Taoist dress<br>
      to don;<br>
  How sad, alas! of a reputed house and noble kindred the scion,<br>
  Alone, behold! she sleeps under a glimmering light, an old idol for<br>
      mate.\</p>
<p>Next in order came a hill of ice, on which stood a hen-phoenix, while under it was this motto:</p>
<p>  When time ends, sure coincidence, the phoenix doth alight;<br>
  The talents of this human form all know and living see,<br>
  For first to yield she kens, then to control, and third genial to be;<br>
  But sad to say, things in Chin Ling are in more sorry plight.\</p>
<p>This was succeeded by a representation of a desolate village, and a dreary inn. A pretty girl sat in there, spinning thread. These were the sentiments affixed below:</p>
<p>  When riches will have flown will honours then avail?<br>
  When ruin breaks your home, e'en relatives will fail!<br>
  But sudden through the aid extended to Dame Liu,<br>
  A friend in need fortune will make to rise for you.\</p>
<p>Following these verses, was drawn a pot of Orchids, by the side of which, was a beautiful maiden in a phoenix-crown and cloudy mantle (bridal dress); and to this picture was appended this device:</p>
<p>  What time spring wanes, then fades the bloom of peach as well as plum!<br>
  Who ever can like a pot of the olea be winsome!<br>
  With ice thy purity will vie, vain their envy will be!<br>
  In vain a laughing-stock people will try to make of thee.\</p>
<p>At the end of this poetical device, came the representation of a lofty edifice, on which was a beauteous girl, suspending herself on a beam to commit suicide; with this verse:</p>
<p>  Love high as heav'n, love ocean-wide, thy lovely form will don;<br>
  What time love will encounter love, license must rise wanton;<br>
  Why hold that all impiety in Jung doth find its spring,<br>
  The source of trouble, verily, is centred most in Ning.\</p>
<p>Pao-yü was still bent upon prosecuting his perusal, when the Fairy perceiving that his intellect was eminent and bright, and his natural talents quickwitted, and apprehending lest the decrees of heaven should be divulged, hastily closed the Book of Record, and addressed herself to Pao-yü. &quot;Come along with me,&quot; she said smiling, &quot;and see some wonderful scenery. What's the need of staying here and beating this gourd of ennui?&quot;</p>
<p>In a dazed state, Pao-yü listlessly discarded the record, and again followed in the footsteps of the Fairy. On their arrival at the back, he saw carnation portières, and embroidered curtains, ornamented pillars, and carved eaves. But no words can adequately give an idea of the vermilion apartments glistening with splendour, of the floors garnished with gold, of the snow reflecting lustrous windows, of the palatial mansions made of gems. He also saw fairyland flowers, beautiful and fragrant, and extraordinary vegetation, full of perfume. The spot was indeed elysian.</p>
<p>He again heard the Fairy observe with a smiling face: &quot;Come out all of you at once and greet the honoured guest!&quot;</p>
<p>These words were scarcely completed, when he espied fairies walk out of the mansion, all of whom were, with their dangling lotus sleeves, and their fluttering feather habiliments, as comely as spring flowers, and as winsome as the autumn moon. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yü, they all, with one voice, resentfully reproached the Monitory Vision Fairy. &quot;Ignorant as to who the honoured guest could be,&quot; they argued, &quot;we hastened to come out to offer our greetings simply because you, elder sister, had told us that, on this day, and at this very time, there would be sure to come on a visit, the spirit of the younger sister of Chiang Chu. That's the reason why we've been waiting for ever so long; and now why do you, in lieu of her, introduce this vile object to contaminate the confines of pure and spotless maidens?&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Pao-yü heard these remarks, he was forthwith plunged in such a state of consternation that he would have retired, but he found it impossible to do so. In fact, he felt the consciousness of the foulness and corruption of his own nature quite intolerable. The Monitory Vision Fairy promptly took Pao-yü's hand in her own, and turning towards her younger sisters, smiled and explained: &quot;You, and all of you, are not aware of the why and wherefore. To-day I did mean to have gone to the Jung mansion to fetch Chiang Chu, but as I went by the Ning mansion, I unexpectedly came across the ghosts of the two dukes of Jung and Ning, who addressed me in this wise: 'Our family has, since the dynasty established itself on the Throne, enjoyed merit and fame, which pervaded many ages, and riches and honours transmitted from generation to generation. One hundred years have already elapsed, but this good fortune has now waned, and this propitious luck is exhausted; so much so that they could not be retrieved! Our sons and grandsons may be many, but there is no one among them who has the means to continue the family estate, with the exception of our kindred grandson, Pao-yü alone, who, though perverse in disposition and wayward by nature, is nevertheless intelligent and quick-witted and qualified in a measure to give effect to our hopes. But alas! the good fortune of our family is entirely decayed, so that we fear there is no person to incite him to enter the right way! Fortunately you worthy fairy come at an unexpected moment, and we venture to trust that you will, above all things, warn him against the foolish indulgence of inordinate desire, lascivious affections and other such things, in the hope that he may, at your instigation, be able to escape the snares of those girls who will allure him with their blandishments, and to enter on the right track; and we two brothers will be ever grateful.'</p>
<p>&quot;On language such as this being addressed to me, my feelings of commiseration naturally burst forth; and I brought him here, and bade him, first of all, carefully peruse the records of the whole lives of the maidens in his family, belonging to the three grades, the upper, middle and lower, but as he has not yet fathomed the import, I have consequently led him into this place to experience the vision of drinking, eating, singing and licentious love, in the hope, there is no saying, of his at length attaining that perception.&quot;</p>
<p>Having concluded these remarks, she led Pao-yü by the hand into the apartment, where he felt a whiff of subtle fragrance, but what it was that reached his nostrils he could not tell.</p>
<p>To Pao-yü's eager and incessant inquiries, the Fairy made reply with a sardonic smile. &quot;This perfume,&quot; she said, &quot;is not to be found in the world, and how could you discern what it is? This is made of the essence of the first sprouts of rare herbs, growing on all hills of fame and places of superior excellence, admixed with the oil of every species of splendid shrubs in precious groves, and is called the marrow of Conglomerated Fragrance.&quot;</p>
<p>At these words Pao-yü was, of course, full of no other feeling than wonder.</p>
<p>The whole party advanced and took their seats, and a young maidservant presented tea, which Pao-yü found of pure aroma, of excellent flavour and of no ordinary kind. &quot;What is the name of this tea?&quot; he therefore asked; upon which the Fairy explained. &quot;This tea,&quot; she added, &quot;originates from the Hills of Emitted Spring and the Valley of Drooping Fragrance, and is, besides, brewed in the night dew, found on spiritual plants and divine leaves. The name of this tea is 'one thousand red in one hole.'&quot;</p>
<p>At these words Pao-yü nodded his head, and extolled its qualities. Espying in the room lutes, with jasper mountings, and tripods, inlaid with gems, antique paintings, and new poetical works, which were to be seen everywhere, he felt more than ever in a high state of delight. Below the windows, were also shreds of velvet sputtered about and a toilet case stained with the traces of time and smudged with cosmetic; while on the partition wall was likewise suspended a pair of scrolls, with the inscription:</p>
<p>  A lonesome, small, ethereal, beauteous nook!<br>
  What help is there, but Heaven's will to brook?\</p>
<p>Pao-yü having completed his inspection felt full of admiration, and proceeded to ascertain the names and surnames of the Fairies. One was called the Fairy of Lustful Dreams; another &quot;the High Ruler of Propagated Passion;&quot; the name of one was &quot;the Golden Maiden of Perpetuated Sorrow;&quot; of another the &quot;Intelligent Maiden of Transmitted Hatred.&quot; (In fact,) the respective Taoist appellations were not of one and the same kind.</p>
<p>In a short while, young maid-servants came in and laid the table, put the chairs in their places, and spread out wines and eatables. There were actually crystal tankards overflowing with luscious wines, and amber glasses full to the brim with pearly strong liquors. But still less need is there to give any further details about the sumptuousness of the refreshments.</p>
<p>Pao-yü found it difficult, on account of the unusual purity of the bouquet of the wine, to again restrain himself from making inquiries about it.</p>
<p>&quot;This wine,&quot; observed the Monitory Dream Fairy, &quot;is made of the twigs of hundreds of flowers, and the juice of ten thousands of trees, with the addition of must composed of unicorn marrow, and yeast prepared with phoenix milk. Hence the name of 'Ten thousand Beauties in one Cup' was given to it.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü sang its incessant praise, and, while he sipped his wine, twelve dancing girls came forward, and requested to be told what songs they were to sing.</p>
<p>&quot;Take,&quot; suggested the Fairy, &quot;the newly-composed Twelve Sections of the<br>
Dream of the Red Chamber, and sing them.&quot;\</p>
<p>The singing girls signified their obedience, and forthwith they lightly clapped the castagnettes and gently thrummed the virginals. These were the words which they were heard to sing:</p>
<p>At the time of the opening of the heavens and the laying out of the earth chaos prevailed.</p>
<p>They had just sung this one line when the Fairy exclaimed: &quot;This ballad is unlike the ballads written in the dusty world whose purport is to hand down remarkable events, in which the distinction of scholars, girls, old men and women, and fools is essential, and in which are furthermore introduced the lyrics of the Southern and Northern Palaces. These fairy songs consist either of elegaic effusions on some person or impressions of some occurrence or other, and are impromptu songs readily set to the music of wind or string instruments, so that any one who is not cognisant of their gist cannot appreciate the beauties contained in them. So you are not likely, I fear, to understand this lyric with any clearness; and unless you first peruse the text and then listen to the ballad, you will, instead of pleasure, feel as if you were chewing wax (devoid of any zest).&quot;</p>
<p>After these remarks, she turned her head round, and directed a young maid-servant to fetch the text of the Dream of the Red Chamber, which she handed to Pao-yü, who took it over; and as he followed the words with his eyes, with his ears he listened to the strains of this song:</p>
<p>Preface of the Bream of the Red Chamber.&mdash;When the Heavens were opened and earth was laid out chaos prevailed! What was the germ of love? It arises entirely from the strength of licentious love.</p>
<p>What day, by the will of heaven, I felt wounded at heart, and what time I was at leisure, I made an attempt to disburden my sad heart; and with this object in view I indited this Dream of the Bed Chamber, on the subject of a disconsolate gold trinket and an unfortunate piece of jade.</p>
<p>Waste of a whole Lifetime. All maintain that the match between gold and jade will be happy. All I can think of is the solemn oath contracted in days gone by by the plant and stone! Vain will I gaze upon the snow, Hsüeh, [Pao-ch'ai], pure as crystal and lustrous like a gem of the eminent priest living among the hills! Never will I forget the noiseless Fairy Grove, Lin [Tai-yü], beyond the confines of the mortal world! Alas! now only have I come to believe that human happiness is incomplete; and that a couple may be bound by the ties of wedlock for life, but that after all their hearts are not easy to lull into contentment.</p>
<p>Vain knitting of the brows. The one is a spirit flower of Fairyland; the other is a beautiful jade without a blemish. Do you maintain that their union will not be remarkable? Why how then is it that he has come to meet her again in this existence? If the union will you say, be strange, how is it then that their love affair will be but empty words? The one in her loneliness will give way to useless sighs. The other in vain will yearn and crave. The one will be like the reflection of the moon in water; the other like a flower reflected in a mirror. Consider, how many drops of tears can there be in the eyes? and how could they continue to drop from autumn to winter and from spring to flow till summer time?</p>
<p>But to come to Pao-yü. After he had heard these ballads, so diffuse and vague, he failed to see any point of beauty in them; but the plaintive melody of the sound was nevertheless sufficient to drive away his spirit and exhilarate his soul. Hence it was that he did not make any inquiries about the arguments, and that he did not ask about the matter treated, but simply making these ballads the means for the time being of dispelling melancholy, he therefore went on with the perusal of what came below.</p>
<p>Despicable Spirit of Death! You will be rejoicing that glory is at its height when hateful death will come once again, and with eyes wide with horror, you will discard all things, and dimly and softly the fragrant spirit will waste and dissolve! You will yearn for native home, but distant will be the way, and lofty the mountains. Hence it is that you will betake yourself in search of father and mother, while they lie under the influence of a dream, and hold discourse with them. &quot;Your child,&quot; you will say, &quot;has already trodden the path of death! Oh my parents, it behoves you to speedily retrace your steps and make good your escape!&quot;</p>
<p>Separated from Relatives. You will speed on a journey of three thousand li at the mercy of wind and rain, and tear yourself from all your family ties and your native home! Your fears will be lest anguish should do any harm to your parents in their failing years! &quot;Father and mother,&quot; you will bid them, &quot;do not think with any anxiety of your child. From ages past poverty as well as success have both had a fixed destiny; and is it likely that separation and reunion are not subject to predestination? Though we may now be far apart in two different places, we must each of us try and preserve good cheer. Your abject child has, it is true, gone from home, but abstain from distressing yourselves on her account!&quot;</p>
<p>Sorrow in the midst of Joy. While wrapped as yet in swaddling clothes, father and mother, both alas! will depart, and dwell though you will in that mass of gauze, who is there who will know how to spoil you with any fond attention? Born you will be fortunately with ample moral courage, and high-minded and boundless resources, for your parents will not have, in the least, their child's secret feelings at heart! You will be like a moon appearing to view when the rain holds up, shedding its rays upon the Jade Hall; or a gentle breeze (wafting its breath upon it). Wedded to a husband, fairy like fair and accomplished, you will enjoy a happiness enduring as the earth and perennial as the Heavens! and you will be the means of snapping asunder the bitter fate of your youth! But, after all, the clouds will scatter in Kao T'ang and the waters of the Hsiang river will get parched! This is the inevitable destiny of dissolution and continuance which prevails in the mortal world, and what need is there to indulge in useless grief?</p>
<p>Intolerable to the world. Your figure will be as winsome as an olea fragrans; your talents as ample as those of a Fairy! You will by nature be so haughty that of the whole human race few will be like you! You will look upon a meat diet as one of dirt, and treat splendour as coarse and loathsome! And yet you will not be aware that your high notions will bring upon you the excessive hatred of man! You will be very eager in your desire after chastity, but the human race will despise you! Alas, you will wax old in that antique temple hall under a faint light, where you will waste ungrateful for beauty, looks and freshness! But after all you will still be worldly, corrupt and unmindful of your vows; just like a spotless white jade you will be whose fate is to fall into the mire! And what need will there be for the grandson of a prince or the son of a duke to deplore that his will not be the good fortune (of winning your affections)?</p>
<p>The Voluptuary. You will resemble a wolf in the mountains! a savage beast devoid of all human feeling! Regardless in every way of the obligations of days gone by, your sole pleasure will be in the indulgence of haughtiness, extravagance, licentiousness and dissolute habits! You will be inordinate in your conjugal affections, and look down upon the beautiful charms of the child of a marquis, as if they were cat-tail rush or willow; trampling upon the honourable daughter of a ducal mansion, as if she were one of the common herd. Pitiful to say, the fragrant spirit and beauteous ghost will in a year softly and gently pass away!</p>
<p>The Perception that all things are transient like flowers. You will look lightly upon the three springs and regard the blush of the peach and the green of the willow as of no avail. You will beat out the fire of splendour, and treat solitary retirement as genial! What is it that you say about the delicate peaches in the heavens (marriage) being excellent, and the petals of the almond in the clouds being plentiful (children)? Let him who has after all seen one of them, (really a mortal being) go safely through the autumn, (wade safely through old age), behold the people in the white Poplar village groan and sigh; and the spirits under the green maple whine and moan! Still more wide in expanse than even the heavens is the dead vegetation which covers the graves! The moral is this, that the burden of man is poverty one day and affluence another; that bloom in spring, and decay in autumn, constitute the doom of vegetable life! In the same way, this calamity of birth and the visitation of death, who is able to escape? But I have heard it said that there grows in the western quarter a tree called the P'o So (Patient Bearing) which bears the fruit of Immortal life!</p>
<p>The bane of Intelligence. Yours will be the power to estimate, in a thorough manner, the real motives of all things, as yours will be intelligence of an excessive degree; but instead (of reaping any benefit) you will cast the die of your own existence! The heart of your previous life is already reduced to atoms, and when you shall have died, your nature will have been intelligent to no purpose! Your home will be in easy circumstances; your family will enjoy comforts; but your connexions will, at length, fall a prey to death, and the inmates of your family scatter, each one of you speeding in a different direction, making room for others! In vain, you will have harassed your mind with cankering thoughts for half a lifetime; for it will be just as if you had gone through the confused mazes of a dream on the third watch! Sudden a crash (will be heard) like the fall of a spacious palace, and a dusky gloominess (will supervene) such as is caused by a lamp about to spend itself! Alas! a spell of happiness will be suddenly (dispelled by) adversity! Woe is man in the world! for his ultimate doom is difficult to determine!</p>
<p>Leave behind a residue of happiness! Hand down an excess of happiness; hand down an excess of happiness! Unexpectedly you will come across a benefactor! Fortunate enough your mother, your own mother, will have laid by a store of virtue and secret meritorious actions! My advice to you, mankind, is to relieve the destitute and succour the distressed! Do not resemble those who will harp after lucre and show themselves unmindful of the ties of relationship: that wolflike maternal uncle of yours and that impostor of a brother! True it is that addition and subtraction, increase and decrease, (reward and punishment,) rest in the hands of Heaven above!</p>
<p>Splendour at last. Loving affection in a mirror will be still more ephemeral than fame in a dream. That fine splendour will fleet how soon! Make no further allusion to embroidered curtain, to bridal coverlet; for though you may come to wear on your head a pearl-laden coronet, and, on your person, a jacket ornamented with phoenixes, yours will not nevertheless be the means to atone for the short life (of your husband)! Though the saying is that mankind should not have, in their old age, the burden of poverty to bear, yet it is also essential that a store of benevolent deeds should be laid up for the benefit of sons and grandsons! (Your son) may come to be dignified in appearance and wear on his head the official tassel, and on his chest may be suspended the gold seal resplendent in lustre; he may be imposing in his majesty, and he may rise high in status and emoluments, but the dark and dreary way which leads to death is short! Are the generals and ministers who have been from ages of old still in the flesh, forsooth? They exist only in a futile name handed down to posterity to reverence!</p>
<p>Death ensues when things propitious reign! Upon the ornamented beam will settle at the close of spring the fragrant dust! Your reckless indulgence of licentious love and your naturally moonlike face will soon be the source of the ruin of a family. The decadence of the family estate will emanate entirely from Ching; while the wane of the family affairs will be entirely attributable to the fault of Ning! Licentious love will be the main reason of the long-standing grudge.</p>
<p>The flying birds each perch upon the trees! The family estates of those in official positions will fade! The gold and silver of the rich and honoured will be scattered! those who will have conferred benefit will, even in death, find the means of escape! those devoid of human feelings will reap manifest retribution! Those indebted for a life will make, in due time, payment with their lives; those indebted for tears have already (gone) to exhaust their tears! Mutual injuries will be revenged in no light manner! Separation and reunion will both alike be determined by predestination! You wish to know why your life will be short; look into your previous existence! Verily, riches and honours, which will come with old age, will likewise be a question of chance! Those who will hold the world in light esteem will retire within the gate of abstraction; while those who will be allured by enticement will have forfeited their lives (The Chia family will fulfil its destiny) as surely as birds take to the trees after they have exhausted all they had to eat, and which as they drop down will pile up a hoary, vast and lofty heap of dust, (leaving) indeed a void behind!</p>
<p>When the maidens had finished the ballads, they went on to sing the &quot;Supplementary Record;&quot; but the Monitory Vision Fairy, perceiving the total absence of any interest in Pao-yü, heaved a sigh. &quot;You silly brat!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;What! haven't you, even now, attained perception!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's no need for you to go on singing,&quot; speedily observed Pao-yü, as he interrupted the singing maidens; and feeling drowsy and dull, he pleaded being under the effects of wine, and begged to be allowed to lie down.</p>
<p>The Fairy then gave orders to clear away the remains of the feast, and escorted Pao-yü to a suite of female apartments, where the splendour of such objects as were laid out was a thing which he had not hitherto seen. But what evoked in him wonder still more intense, was the sight, at an early period, of a girl seated in the room, who, in the freshness of her beauty and winsomeness of her charms, bore some resemblance to Pao-ch'ai, while, in elegance and comeliness, on the other hand, to Tai-yu.</p>
<p>While he was plunged in a state of perplexity, the Fairy suddenly remarked: &quot;All those female apartments and ladies' chambers in so many wealthy and honourable families in the world are, without exception, polluted by voluptuous opulent puppets and by all that bevy of profligate girls. But still more despicable are those from old till now numberless dissolute roués, one and all of whom maintain that libidinous affections do not constitute lewdness; and who try, further, to prove that licentious love is not tantamount to lewdness. But all these arguments are mere apologies for their shortcomings, and a screen for their pollutions; for if libidinous affection be lewdness, still more does the perception of licentious love constitute lewdness. Hence it is that the indulgence of sensuality and the gratification of licentious affection originate entirely from a relish of lust, as well as from a hankering after licentious love. Lo you, who are the object of my love, are the most lewd being under the heavens from remote ages to the present time!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü was quite dumbstruck by what he heard, and hastily smiling, he said by way of reply: &quot;My Fairy labours under a misapprehension. Simply because of my reluctance to read my books my parents have, on repeated occasions, extended to me injunction and reprimand, and would I have the courage to go so far as to rashly plunge in lewd habits? Besides, I am still young in years, and have no notion what is implied by lewdness!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not so!&quot; exclaimed the Fairy; &quot;lewdness, although one thing in principle is, as far as meaning goes, subject to different constructions; as is exemplified by those in the world whose heart is set upon lewdness. Some delight solely in faces and figures; others find insatiable pleasure in singing and dancing; some in dalliance and raillery; others in the incessant indulgence of their lusts; and these regret that all the beautiful maidens under the heavens cannot minister to their short-lived pleasure. These several kinds of persons are foul objects steeped skin and all in lewdness. The lustful love, for instance, which has sprung to life and taken root in your natural affections, I and such as myself extend to it the character of an abstract lewdness; but abstract lewdness can be grasped by the mind, but cannot be transmitted by the mouth; can be fathomed by the spirit, but cannot be divulged in words. As you now are imbued with this desire only in the abstract, you are certainly well fit to be a trustworthy friend in (Fairyland) inner apartments, but, on the path of the mortal world, you will inevitably be misconstrued and defamed; every mouth will ridicule you; every eye will look down upon you with contempt. After meeting recently your worthy ancestors, the two Dukes of Ning and Jung, who opened their hearts and made their wishes known to me with such fervour, (but I will not have you solely on account of the splendour of our inner apartments look down despisingly upon the path of the world), I consequently led you along, my son, and inebriated you with luscious wines, steeped you in spiritual tea, and admonished you with excellent songs, bringing also here a young sister of mine, whose infant name is Chien Mei, and her style K'o Ching, to be given to you as your wedded wife. To-night, the time will be propitious and suitable for the immediate consummation of the union, with the express object of letting you have a certain insight into the fact that if the condition of the abode of spirits within the confines of Fairyland be still so (imperfect), how much the more so should be the nature of the affections which prevail in the dusty world; with the intent that from this time forth you should positively break loose from bondage, perceive and amend your former disposition, devote your attention to the works of Confucius and Mencius, and set your steady purpose upon the principles of morality.&quot;</p>
<p>Having ended these remarks, she initiated him into the mysteries of licentious love, and, pushing Pao-yü into the room, she closed the door, and took her departure all alone. Pao-yü in a dazed state complied with the admonitions given him by the Fairy, and the natural result was, of course, a violent flirtation, the circumstances of which it would be impossible to recount.</p>
<p>When the next day came, he was by that time so attached to her by ties of tender love and their conversation was so gentle and full of charm that he could not brook to part from K'o Ching. Hand-in-hand, the two of them therefore, went out for a stroll, when they unexpectedly reached a place, where nothing else met their gaze than thorns and brambles, which covered the ground, and a wolf and a tiger walking side by side. Before them stretched the course of a black stream, which obstructed their progress; and over this stream there was, what is more, no bridge to enable one to cross it.</p>
<p>While they were exercising their minds with perplexity, they suddenly espied the Fairy coming from the back in pursuit of them. &quot;Desist at once,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;from making any advance into the stream; it is urgent that you should, with all speed, turn your faces round!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü lost no time in standing still. &quot;What is this place?&quot; he inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the Ford of Enticement,&quot; explained the Fairy. &quot;Its depth is ten thousand chang; its breadth is a thousand li; in its stream there are no boats or paddles by means of which to effect a passage. There is simply a raft, of which Mu Chu-shih directs the rudder, and which Hui Shih chen punts with the poles. They receive no compensation in the shape of gold or silver, but when they come across any one whose destiny it is to cross, they ferry him over. You now have by accident strolled as far as here, and had you fallen into the stream you would have rendered quite useless the advice and admonition which I previously gave you.&quot;</p>
<p>These words were scarcely concluded, when suddenly was heard from the midst of the Ford of Enticement, a sound like unto a peal of thunder, whereupon a whole crowd of gobblins and sea-urchins laid hands upon Pao-yü and dragged him down.</p>
<p>This so filled Pao-yü with consternation that he fell into a perspiration as profuse as rain, and he simultaneously broke forth and shouted, &quot;Rescue me, K'o Ching!&quot;</p>
<p>These cries so terrified Hsi Jen and the other waiting-maids, that they rushed forward, and taking Pao-yü in their arms, &quot;Don't be afraid, Pao-yü,&quot; they said, &quot;we are here.&quot;</p>
<p>But we must observe that Mrs. Ch'in was just inside the apartment in the act of recommending the young waiting-maids to be mindful that the cats and dogs did not start a fight, when she unawares heard Pao-yü, in his dream, call her by her infant name. In a melancholy mood she therefore communed within herself, &quot;As far as my infant name goes, there is, in this establishment, no one who has any idea what it is, and how is it that he has come to know it, and that he utters it in his dream?&quot; And she was at this period unable to fathom the reason. But, reader, listen to the explanations given in the chapter which follows.</p>

<p>  Chia Pao-yü reaps his first experience in licentious love.<br>
  Old Goody Liu pays a visit to the Jung Kuo Mansion.\</p>
<p>Mrs. Ch'in, to resume our narrative, upon hearing Pao-yü call her in his dream by her infant name, was at heart very exercised, but she did not however feel at liberty to make any minute inquiry.</p>
<p>Pao-yü was, at this time, in such a dazed state, as if he had lost something, and the servants promptly gave him a decoction of lungngan. After he had taken a few sips, he forthwith rose and tidied his clothes.</p>
<p>Hsi Jen put out her hand to fasten the band of his garment, and as soon as she did so, and it came in contact with his person, it felt so icy cold to the touch, covered as it was all over with perspiration, that she speedily withdrew her hand in utter surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter with you?&quot; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>A blush suffused Pao-yü's face, and he took Hsi Jen's hand in a tight grip. Hsi Jen was a girl with all her wits about her; she was besides a couple of years older than Pao-yü and had recently come to know something of the world, so that at the sight of his state, she to a great extent readily accounted for the reason in her heart. From modest shame, she unconsciously became purple in the face, and not venturing to ask another question she continued adjusting his clothes. This task accomplished, she followed him over to old lady Chia's apartments; and after a hurry-scurry meal, they came back to this side, and Hsi Jen availed herself of the absence of the nurses and waiting-maids to hand Pao-yü another garment to change.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, dear Hsi Jen, don't tell any one,&quot; entreated Pao-yü, with concealed shame.</p>
<p>&quot;What did you dream of?&quot; inquired Hsi Jen, smiling, as she tried to stifle her blushes, &quot;and whence comes all this perspiration?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a long story,&quot; said Pao-yü, &quot;which only a few words will not suffice to explain.&quot;</p>
<p>He accordingly recounted minutely, for her benefit, the subject of his dream. When he came to where the Fairy had explained to him the mysteries of love, Hsi Jen was overpowered with modesty and covered her face with her hands; and as she bent down, she gave way to a fit of laughter. Pao-yü had always been fond of Hsi Jen, on account of her gentleness, pretty looks and graceful and elegant manner, and he forthwith expounded to her all the mysteries he had been taught by the Fairy.</p>
<p>Hsi Jen was, of course, well aware that dowager lady Chia had given her over to Pao-yü, so that her present behaviour was likewise no transgression. And subsequently she secretly attempted with Pao-yü a violent flirtation, and lucky enough no one broke in upon them during their tête-à-tête. From this date, Pao-yü treated Hsi Jen with special regard, far more than he showed to the other girls, while Hsi Jen herself was still more demonstrative in her attentions to Pao-yü. But for a time we will make no further remark about them.</p>
<p>As regards the household of the Jung mansion, the inmates may, on adding up the total number, not have been found many; yet, counting the high as well as the low, there were three hundred persons and more. Their affairs may not have been very numerous, still there were, every day, ten and twenty matters to settle; in fact, the household resembled, in every way, ravelled hemp, devoid even of a clue-end, which could be used as an introduction.</p>
<p>Just as we were considering what matter and what person it would be best to begin writing of, by a lucky coincidence suddenly from a distance of a thousand li, a person small and insignificant as a grain of mustard seed happened, on account of her distant relationship with the Jung family, to come on this very day to the Jung mansion on a visit. We shall therefore readily commence by speaking of this family, as it after all affords an excellent clue for a beginning.</p>
<p>The surname of this mean and humble family was in point of fact Wang. They were natives of this district. Their ancestor had filled a minor office in the capital, and had, in years gone by, been acquainted with lady Feng's grandfather, that is madame Wang's father. Being covetous of the influence and affluence of the Wang family, he consequently joined ancestors with them, and was recognised by them as a nephew.</p>
<p>At that time, there were only madame Wang's eldest brother, that is lady Feng's father, and madame Wang herself, who knew anything of these distant relations, from the fact of having followed their parents to the capital. The rest of the family had one and all no idea about them.</p>
<p>This ancestor had, at this date, been dead long ago, leaving only one son called Wang Ch'eng. As the family estate was in a state of ruin, he once more moved outside the city walls and settled down in his native village. Wang Ch'eng also died soon after his father, leaving a son, known in his infancy as Kou Erh, who married a Miss Liu, by whom he had a son called by the infant name of Pan Erh, as well as a daughter, Ch'ing Erh. His family consisted of four, and he earned a living from farming.</p>
<p>As Kou Erh was always busy with something or other during the day and his wife, dame Liu, on the other hand, drew the water, pounded the rice and attended to all the other domestic concerns, the brother and sister, Ch'ing Erh and Pan Erh, the two of them, had no one to look after them. (Hence it was that) Kou Erh brought over his mother-in-law, old goody Liu, to live with them.</p>
<p>This goody Liu was an old widow, with a good deal of experience. She had besides no son round her knees, so that she was dependent for her maintenance on a couple of acres of poor land, with the result that when her son-in-law received her in his home, she naturally was ever willing to exert heart and mind to help her daughter and her son-in-law to earn their living.</p>
<p>This year, the autumn had come to an end, winter had commenced, and the weather had begun to be quite cold. No provision had been made in the household for the winter months, and Kou Erh was, inevitably, exceedingly exercised in his heart. Having had several cups of wine to dispel his distress, he sat at home and tried to seize upon every trifle to give vent to his displeasure. His wife had not the courage to force herself in his way, and hence goody Liu it was who encouraged him, as she could not bear to see the state of the domestic affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't pull me up for talking too much,&quot; she said; &quot;but who of us country people isn't honest and open-hearted? As the size of the bowl we hold, so is the quantity of the rice we eat. In your young days, you were dependent on the support of your old father, so that eating and drinking became quite a habit with you; that's how, at the present time, your resources are quite uncertain; when you had money, you looked ahead, and didn't mind behind; and now that you have no money, you blindly fly into huffs. A fine fellow and a capital hero you have made! Living though we now be away from the capital, we are after all at the feet of the Emperor; this city of Ch'ang Ngan is strewn all over with money, but the pity is that there's no one able to go and fetch it away; and it's no use your staying at home and kicking your feet about.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All you old lady know,&quot; rejoined Kou Erh, after he had heard what she had to say, &quot;is to sit on the couch and talk trash! Is it likely you would have me go and play the robber?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who tells you to become a robber?&quot; asked goody Liu. &quot;But it would be well, after all, that we should put our heads together and devise some means; for otherwise, is the money, pray, able of itself to run into our house?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Had there been a way,&quot; observed Kou Erh, smiling sarcastically, &quot;would I have waited up to this moment? I have besides no revenue collectors as relatives, or friends in official positions; and what way could we devise? 'But even had I any, they wouldn't be likely, I fear, to pay any heed to such as ourselves!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That, too, doesn't follow,&quot; remarked goody Liu; &quot;the planning of affairs rests with man, but the accomplishment of them rests with Heaven. After we have laid our plans, we may, who can say, by relying on the sustenance of the gods, find some favourable occasion. Leave it to me, I'll try and devise some lucky chance for you people! In years gone by, you joined ancestors with the Wang family of Chin Ling, and twenty years back, they treated you with consideration; but of late, you've been so high and mighty, and not condescended to go and bow to them, that an estrangement has arisen. I remember how in years gone by, I and my daughter paid them a visit. The second daughter of the family was really so pleasant and knew so well how to treat people with kindness, and without in fact any high airs! She's at present the wife of Mr. Chia, the second son of the Jung Kuo mansion; and I hear people say that now that she's advanced in years, she's still more considerate to the poor, regardful of the old, and very fond of preparing vegetable food for the bonzes and performing charitable deeds. The head of the Wang mansion has, it is true, been raised to some office on the frontier, but I hope that this lady Secunda will anyhow notice us. How is it then that you don't find your way as far as there; for she may possibly remember old times, and some good may, no one can say, come of it? I only wish that she would display some of her kind-heartedness, and pluck one hair from her person which would be, yea thicker than our waist.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What you suggest, mother, is quite correct,&quot; interposed Mrs. Liu, Kou Erh's wife, who stood by and took up the conversation, &quot;but with such mouth and phiz as yours and mine, how could we present ourselves before her door? Why I fear that the man at her gate won't also like to go and announce us! and we'd better not go and have our mouths slapped in public!&quot;</p>
<p>Kou Erh, who would have thought it, prized highly both affluence and fame, so that when he heard these remarks, he forthwith began to feel at heart a little more at ease. When he furthermore heard what his wife had to say, he at once caught up the word as he smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Old mother,&quot; he rejoined; &quot;since that be your idea, and what's more, you have in days gone by seen this lady on one occasion, why shouldn't you, old lady, start to-morrow on a visit to her and first ascertain how the wind blows!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ai Ya!&quot; exclaimed old Goody, &quot;It may very well be said that the marquis' door is like the wide ocean! what sort of thing am I? why the servants of that family wouldn't even recognise me! even were I to go, it would be on a wild goose chase.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No matter about that,&quot; observed Kou Erh; &quot;I'll tell you a good way; you just take along with you, your grandson, little Pan Erh, and go first and call upon Chou Jui, who is attached to that household; and when once you've seen him, there will be some little chance. This Chou Jui, at one time, was connected with my father in some affair or other, and we were on excellent terms with him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That I too know,&quot; replied goody Liu, &quot;but the thing is that you've had no dealings with him for so long, that who knows how he's disposed towards us now? this would be hard to say. Besides, you're a man, and with a mouth and phiz like that of yours, you couldn't, on any account, go on this errand. My daughter is a young woman, and she too couldn't very well go and expose herself to public gaze. But by my sacrificing this old face of mine, and by going and knocking it (against the wall) there may, after all, be some benefit and all of us might reap profit.&quot;</p>
<p>That very same evening, they laid their plans, and the next morning before the break of day, old goody Liu speedily got up, and having performed her toilette, she gave a few useful hints to Pan Erh; who, being a child of five or six years of age, was, when he heard that he was to be taken into the city, at once so delighted that there was nothing that he would not agree to.</p>
<p>Without further delay, goody Liu led off Pan Erh, and entered the city, and reaching the Ning Jung street, she came to the main entrance of the Jung mansion, where, next to the marble lions, were to be seen a crowd of chairs and horses. Goody Liu could not however muster the courage to go by, but having shaken her clothes, and said a few more seasonable words to Pan Erh, she subsequently squatted in front of the side gate, whence she could see a number of servants, swelling out their chests, pushing out their stomachs, gesticulating with their hands and kicking their feet about, while they were seated at the main entrance chattering about one thing and another.</p>
<p>Goody Liu felt constrained to edge herself forward. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; she ventured, &quot;may happiness betide you!&quot;</p>
<p>The whole company of servants scrutinised her for a time. &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; they at length inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;I've come to look up Mr. Chou, an attendant of my lady's,&quot; remarked goody Liu, as she forced a smile; &quot;which of you, gentlemen, shall I trouble to do me the favour of asking him to come out?&quot;</p>
<p>The servants, after hearing what she had to say, paid, the whole number of them, no heed to her; and it was after the lapse of a considerable time that they suggested: &quot;Go and wait at a distance, at the foot of that wall; and in a short while, the visitors, who are in their house, will be coming out.&quot;</p>
<p>Among the party of attendants was an old man, who interposed,</p>
<p>&quot;Don't baffle her object,&quot; he expostulated; &quot;why make a fool of her?&quot; and turning to goody Liu: &quot;This Mr. Chou,&quot; he said, &quot;is gone south: his house is at the back row; his wife is anyhow at home; so go round this way, until you reach the door, at the back street, where, if you will ask about her, you will be on the right track.&quot;</p>
<p>Goody Liu, having expressed her thanks, forthwith went, leading Pan Erh by the hand, round to the back door, where she saw several pedlars resting their burdens. There were also those who sold things to eat, and those who sold playthings and toys; and besides these, twenty or thirty boys bawled and shouted, making quite a noise.</p>
<p>Goody Liu readily caught hold of one of them. &quot;I'd like to ask you just a word, my young friend,&quot; she observed; &quot;there's a Mrs. Chou here; is she at home?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Which Mrs. Chou?&quot; inquired the boy; &quot;we here have three Mrs. Chous; and there are also two young married ladies of the name of Chou. What are the duties of the one you want, I wonder ?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's a waiting-woman of my lady,&quot; replied goody Liu.</p>
<p>&quot;It's easy to get at her,&quot; added the boy; &quot;just come along with me.&quot;</p>
<p>Leading the way for goody Liu into the backyard, they reached the wall of a court, when he pointed and said, &quot;This is her house.&mdash;Mother Chou!&quot; he went on to shout with alacrity; &quot;there's an old lady who wants to see you.&quot;</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife was at home, and with all haste she came out to greet her visitor. &quot;Who is it?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>Goody Liu advanced up to her. &quot;How are you,&quot; she inquired, &quot;Mrs. Chou?&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chou looked at her for some time before she at length smiled and replied, &quot;Old goody Liu, are you well? How many years is it since we've seen each other; tell me, for I forget just now; but please come in and sit.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're a lady of rank,&quot; answered goody Liu smiling, as she walked along, &quot;and do forget many things. How could you remember such as ourselves?&quot;</p>
<p>With these words still in her mouth, they had entered the house, whereupon Mrs. Chou ordered a hired waiting-maid to pour the tea. While they were having their tea she remarked, &quot;How Pan Erh has managed to grow!&quot; and then went on to make inquiries on the subject of various matters, which had occurred after their separation.</p>
<p>&quot;To-day,&quot; she also asked of goody Liu, &quot;were you simply passing by? or did you come with any express object?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've come, the fact is, with an object!&quot; promptly replied goody Liu; &quot;(first of all) to see you, my dear sister-in-law; and, in the second place also, to inquire after my lady's health. If you could introduce me to see her for a while, it would be better; but if you can't, I must readily borrow your good offices, my sister-in-law, to convey my message.&quot;</p>
<p>Mr. Chou Jui's wife, after listening to these words, at once became to a great extent aware of the object of her visit. Her husband had, however, in years gone by in his attempt to purchase some land, obtained considerably the support of Kou Erh, so that when she, on this occasion, saw goody Liu in such a dilemma, she could not make up her mind to refuse her wish. Being in the second place keen upon making a display of her own respectability, she therefore said smilingly:</p>
<p>&quot;Old goody Liu, pray compose your mind! You've come from far off with a pure heart and honest purpose, and how can I ever not show you the way how to see this living Buddha? Properly speaking, when people come and guests arrive, and verbal messages have to be given, these matters are not any of my business, as we all here have each one kind of duties to carry out. My husband has the special charge of the rents of land coming in, during the two seasons of spring and autumn, and when at leisure, he takes the young gentlemen out of doors, and then his business is done. As for myself, I have to accompany my lady and young married ladies on anything connected with out-of-doors; but as you are a relative of my lady and have besides treated me as a high person and come to me for help, I'll, after all, break this custom and deliver your message. There's only one thing, however, and which you, old lady, don't know. We here are not what we were five years before. My lady now doesn't much worry herself about anything; and it's entirely lady Secunda who looks after the menage. But who do you presume is this lady Secunda? She's the niece of my lady, and the daughter of my master, the eldest maternal uncle of by-gone days. Her infant name was Feng Ko.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it really she?&quot; inquired promptly goody Liu, after this explanation. &quot;Isn't it strange? what I said about her years back has come out quite correct; but from all you say, shall I to-day be able to see her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That goes without saying,&quot; replied Chou Jui's wife; &quot;when any visitors come now-a-days, it's always lady Feng who does the honours and entertains them, and it's better to-day that you should see her for a while, for then you will not have walked all this way to no purpose.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O mi to fu!&quot; exclaimed old goody Liu; &quot;I leave it entirely to your convenience, sister-in-law.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's that you're saying?&quot; observed Chou Jui's wife. &quot;The proverb says: 'Our convenience is the convenience of others.' All I have to do is to just utter one word, and what trouble will that be to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, she bade the young waiting maid go to the side pavilion, and quietly ascertain whether, in her old ladyship's apartment, table had been laid.</p>
<p>The young waiting-maid went on this errand, and during this while, the two of them continued a conversation on certain irrelevant matters.</p>
<p>&quot;This lady Feng,&quot; observed goody Liu, &quot;can this year be no older than twenty, and yet so talented as to manage such a household as this! the like of her is not easy to find!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hai! my dear old goody,&quot; said Chou Jui's wife, after listening to her, &quot;it's not easy to explain; but this lady Feng, though young in years, is nevertheless, in the management of affairs, superior to any man. She has now excelled the others and developed the very features of a beautiful young woman. To say the least, she has ten thousand eyes in her heart, and were they willing to wager their mouths, why ten men gifted with eloquence couldn't even outdo her! But by and bye, when you've seen her, you'll know all about her! There's only this thing, she can't help being rather too severe in her treatment of those below her.&quot;</p>
<p>While yet she spake, the young waiting-maid returned. &quot;In her venerable lady's apartment,&quot; she reported, &quot;repast has been spread, and already finished; lady Secunda is in madame Wang's chamber.&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Chou Jui's wife heard this news, she speedily got up and pressed goody Liu to be off at once. &quot;This is,&quot; she urged, &quot;just the hour for her meal, and as she is free we had better first go and wait for her; for were we to be even one step too late, a crowd of servants will come with their reports, and it will then be difficult to speak to her; and after her siesta, she'll have still less time to herself.&quot;</p>
<p>As she passed these remarks, they all descended the couch together. Goody Liu adjusted their dresses, and, having impressed a few more words of advice on Pan Erh, they followed Chou Jui's wife through winding passages to Chia Lien's house. They came in the first instance into the side pavilion, where Chou Jui's wife placed old goody Liu to wait a little, while she herself went ahead, past the screen-wall and into the entrance of the court.</p>
<p>Hearing that lady Feng had not come out, she went in search of an elderly waiting-maid of lady Feng, P'ing Erh by name, who enjoyed her confidence, to whom Chou Jui's wife first recounted from beginning to end the history of old goody Liu.</p>
<p>&quot;She has come to-day,&quot; she went on to explain, &quot;from a distance to pay her obeisance. In days gone by, our lady used often to meet her, so that, on this occasion, she can't but receive her; and this is why I've brought her in! I'll wait here for lady Feng to come down, and explain everything to her; and I trust she'll not call me to task for officious rudeness.&quot;</p>
<p>P'ing Erh, after hearing what she had to say, speedily devised the plan of asking them to walk in, and to sit there pending (lady Feng's arrival), when all would be right.</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife thereupon went out and led them in. When they ascended the steps of the main apartment, a young waiting-maid raised a red woollen portière, and as soon as they entered the hall, they smelt a whiff of perfume as it came wafted into their faces: what the scent was they could not discriminate; but their persons felt as if they were among the clouds.</p>
<p>The articles of furniture and ornaments in the whole room were all so brilliant to the sight, and so vying in splendour that they made the head to swim and the eyes to blink, and old goody Liu did nothing else the while than nod her head, smack her lips and invoke Buddha. Forthwith she was led to the eastern side into the suite of apartments, where was the bedroom of Chia Lien's eldest daughter. P'ing Erh, who was standing by the edge of the stove-couch, cast a couple of glances at old goody Liu, and felt constrained to inquire how she was, and to press her to have a seat.</p>
<p>Goody Liu, noticing that P'ing Erh was entirely robed in silks, that she had gold pins fixed in her hair, and silver ornaments in her coiffure, and that her countenance resembled a flower or the moon (in beauty), readily imagined her to be lady Feng, and was about to address her as my lady; but when she heard Mrs. Chou speak to her as Miss P'ing, and P'ing Erh promptly address Chou Jui's wife as Mrs. Chou, she eventually became aware that she could be no more than a waiting-maid of a certain respectability.</p>
<p>She at once pressed old goody Liu and Pan Erh to take a seat on the stove-couch. P'ing Erh and Chou Jui's wife sat face to face, on the edges of the couch. The waiting-maids brought the tea. After they had partaken of it, old goody Liu could hear nothing but a &quot;lo tang, lo tang&quot; noise, resembling very much the sound of a bolting frame winnowing flour, and she could not resist looking now to the East, and now to the West. Suddenly in the great Hall, she espied, suspended on a pillar, a box at the bottom of which hung something like the weight of a balance, which incessantly wagged to and fro.</p>
<p>&quot;What can this thing be?&quot; communed goody Liu in her heart, &quot;What can be its use?&quot; While she was aghast, she unexpectedly heard a sound of &quot;tang&quot; like the sound of a golden bell or copper cymbal, which gave her quite a start. In a twinkle of the eyes followed eight or nine consecutive strokes; and she was bent upon inquiring what it was, when she caught sight of several waiting-maids enter in a confused crowd. &quot;Our lady has come down!&quot; they announced.</p>
<p>P'ìng Erh, together with Chou Jui's wife, rose with all haste. &quot;Old goody Liu,&quot; they urged, &quot;do sit down and wait till it's time, when we'll come and ask you in.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, they went out to meet lady Feng.</p>
<p>Old goody Liu, with suppressed voice and ear intent, waited in perfect silence. She heard at a distance the voices of some people laughing, whereupon about ten or twenty women, with rustling clothes and petticoats, made their entrance, one by one, into the hall, and thence into the room on the other quarter. She also detected two or three women, with red-lacquered boxes in their hands, come over on this part and remain in waiting.</p>
<p>&quot;Get the repast ready!&quot; she heard some one from the offside say.</p>
<p>The servants gradually dispersed and went out; and there only remained in attendance a few of them to bring in the courses. For a long time, not so much as the caw of a crow could be heard, when she unexpectedly perceived two servants carry in a couch-table, and lay it on this side of the divan. Upon this table were placed bowls and plates, in proper order replete, as usual, with fish and meats; but of these only a few kinds were slightly touched.</p>
<p>As soon as Pan Erh perceived (all these delicacies), he set up such a noise, and would have some meat to eat, but goody Liu administered to him such a slap, that he had to keep away.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she saw Mrs. Chou approach, full of smiles, and as she waved her hand, she called her. Goody Liu understood her meaning, and at once pulling Pan Erh off the couch, she proceeded to the centre of the Hall; and after Mrs. Chou had whispered to her again for a while, they came at length with slow step into the room on this side, where they saw on the outside of the door, suspended by brass hooks, a deep red flowered soft portière. Below the window, on the southern side, was a stove-couch, and on this couch was spread a crimson carpet. Leaning against the wooden partition wall, on the east side, stood a chain-embroidered back-cushion and a reclining pillow. There was also spread a large watered satin sitting cushion with a gold embroidered centre, and on the side stood cuspidores made of silver.</p>
<p>Lady Feng, when at home, usually wore on her head a front-piece of dark martin à la Chao Chün, surrounded with tassels of strung pearls. She had on a robe of peach-red flowered satin, a short pelisse of slate-blue stiff silk, lined with squirrel, and a jupe of deep red foreign crepe, lined with ermine. Resplendent with pearl-powder and with cosmetics, she sat in there, stately and majestic, with a small brass poker in her hands, with which she was stirring the ashes of the hand-stove. P'ing Erh stood by the side of the couch, holding a very small lacquered tea-tray. In this tray was a small tea-cup with a cover. Lady Feng neither took any tea, nor did she raise her head, but was intent upon stirring the ashes of the hand-stove.</p>
<p>&quot;How is it you haven't yet asked her to come in?&quot; she slowly inquired; and as she spake, she turned herself round and was about to ask for some tea, when she perceived that Mrs. Chou had already introduced the two persons and that they were standing in front of her.</p>
<p>She forthwith pretended to rise, but did not actually get up, and with a face radiant with smiles, she ascertained about their health, after which she went in to chide Chou Jui's wife. &quot;Why didn't you tell me they had come before?&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Old goody Liu was already by this time prostrated on the ground, and after making several obeisances, &quot;How are you, my lady?&quot; she inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Mrs. Chou,&quot; lady Feng immediately observed, &quot;do pull her up, and don't let her prostrate herself! I'm yet young in years and don't know her much; what's more, I've no idea what's the degree of the relationship between us, and I daren't speak directly to her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is the old lady about whom I spoke a short while back,&quot; speedily explained Mrs. Chou.</p>
<p>Lady Feng nodded her head assentingly.</p>
<p>By this time old goody Liu had taken a seat on the edge of the stove-couch. As for Pan Erh, he had gone further, and taken refuge behind her back; and though she tried, by every means, to coax him to come forward and make a bow, he would not, for the life of him, consent.</p>
<p>&quot;Relatives though we be,&quot; remarked lady Feng, as she smiled, &quot;we haven't seen much of each other, so that our relations have been quite distant. But those who know how matters stand will assert that you all despise us, and won't often come to look us up; while those mean people, who don't know the truth, will imagine that we have no eyes to look at any one.&quot;</p>
<p>Old goody Liu promptly invoked Buddha. &quot;We are at home in great straits,&quot; she pleaded, &quot;and that's why it wasn't easy for us to manage to get away and come! Even supposing we had come as far as this, had we not given your ladyship a slap on the mouth, those gentlemen would also, in point of fact, have looked down upon us as a mean lot.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why, language such as this,&quot; exclaimed lady Feng smilingly, &quot;cannot help making one's heart full of displeasure! We simply rely upon the reputation of our grandfather to maintain the status of a penniless official; that's all! Why, in whose household is there anything substantial? we are merely the denuded skeleton of what we were in days of old, and no more! As the proverb has it: The Emperor himself has three families of poverty-stricken relatives; and how much more such as you and I?&quot;</p>
<p>Having passed these remarks, she inquired of Mrs. Chou, &quot;Have you let madame know, yes or no?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We are now waiting,&quot; replied Mrs. Chou, &quot;for my lady's orders.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go and have a look,&quot; said lady Feng; &quot;but, should there be any one there, or should she be busy, then don't make any mention; but wait until she's free, when you can tell her about it and see what she says.&quot;</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife, having expressed her compliance, went off on this errand. During her absence, lady Feng gave orders to some servants to take a few fruits and hand them to Pan Erh to eat; and she was inquiring about one thing and another, when there came a large number of married women, who had the direction of affairs in the household, to make their several reports.</p>
<p>P'ing Erh announced their arrival to lady Feng, who said: &quot;I'm now engaged in entertaining some guests, so let them come back again in the evening; but should there be anything pressing then bring it in and I'll settle it at once.&quot;</p>
<p>P'ing Erh left the room, but she returned in a short while. &quot;I've asked them,&quot; she observed, &quot;but as there's nothing of any urgency, I told them to disperse.&quot; Lady Feng nodded her head in token of approval, when she perceived Chou Jui's wife come back. &quot;Our lady,&quot; she reported, as she addressed lady Feng, &quot;says that she has no leisure to-day, that if you, lady Secunda, will entertain them, it will come to the same thing; that she's much obliged for their kind attention in going to the trouble of coming; that if they have come simply on a stroll, then well and good, but that if they have aught to say, they should tell you, lady Secunda, which will be tantamount to their telling her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've nothing to say,&quot; interposed old goody Liu. &quot;I simply come to see our elder and our younger lady, which is a duty on my part, a relative as I am.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if there's nothing particular that you've got to say, all right,&quot; Mrs. Chou forthwith added, &quot;but if you do have anything, don't hesitate telling lady Secunda, and it will be just as if you had told our lady.&quot;</p>
<p>As she uttered these words, she winked at goody Liu. Goody Liu understood what she meant, but before she could give vent to a word, her face got scarlet, and though she would have liked not to make any mention of the object of her visit, she felt constrained to suppress her shame and to speak out.</p>
<p>&quot;Properly speaking,&quot; she observed, &quot;this being the first time I see you, my lady, I shouldn't mention what I've to say, but as I come here from far off to seek your assistance, my old friend, I have no help but to mention it.&quot;</p>
<p>She had barely spoken as much as this, when she heard the youths at the inner-door cry out: &quot;The young gentleman from the Eastern Mansion has come.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng promptly interrupted her. &quot;Old goody Liu,&quot; she remarked, &quot;you needn't add anything more.&quot; She, at the same time, inquired, &quot;Where's your master, Mr. Jung?&quot; when became audible the sound of footsteps along the way, and in walked a young man of seventeen or eighteen. His appearance was handsome, his person slender and graceful. He had on light furs, a girdle of value, costly clothes and a beautiful cap.</p>
<p>At this stage, goody Liu did not know whether it was best to sit down or to stand up, neither could she find anywhere to hide herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Pray sit down,&quot; urged lady Feng, with a laugh; &quot;this is my nephew!' Old goody Liu then wriggled herself, now one way, and then another, on to the edge of the couch, where she took a seat.</p>
<p>&quot;My father,&quot; Chia Jung smilingly ventured, &quot;has sent me to ask a favour of you, aunt. On some previous occasion, our grand aunt gave you, dear aunt, a stove-couch glass screen, and as to-morrow father has invited some guests of high standing, he wishes to borrow it to lay it out for a little show; after which he purposes sending it back again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're late by a day,&quot; replied lady Feng. &quot;It was only yesterday that I gave it to some one.&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Jung, upon hearing this, forthwith, with giggles and smiles, made, near the edge of the couch, a sort of genuflexion. &quot;Aunt,&quot; he went on, &quot;if you don't lend it, father will again say that I don't know how to speak, and I shall get another sound thrashing. You must have pity upon your nephew, aunt.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've never seen anything like this,&quot; observed lady Feng sneeringly; &quot;the things belonging to the Wang family are all good, but where have you put all those things of yours? the only good way is that you shouldn't see anything of ours, for as soon as you catch sight of anything, you at once entertain a wish to carry it off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Pray, aunt,&quot; entreated Chia Jung with a smile, &quot;do show me some compassion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mind your skin!&quot; lady Feng warned him, &quot;if you do chip or spoil it in the least.&quot;</p>
<p>She then bade P'ing Erh take the keys of the door of the upstairs room and send for several trustworthy persons to carry it away.</p>
<p>Chia Jung was so elated that his eyebrows dilated and his eyes smiled. &quot;I've brought myself,&quot; he added, with vehemence, &quot;some men to take it away; I won't let them recklessly bump it about.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, he speedily got up and left the room.</p>
<p>Lady Feng suddenly bethought herself of something, and turning towards the window, she called out, &quot;Jung Erh, come back.&quot; Several servants who stood outside caught up her words: &quot;Mr. Jung,&quot; they cried, &quot;you're requested to go back;&quot; whereupon Chia Jung turned round and retraced his steps; and with hands drooping respectfully against his sides, he stood ready to listen to his aunt's wishes.</p>
<p>Lady Feng was however intent upon gently sipping her tea, and after a good long while of abstraction, she at last smiled: &quot;Never mind,&quot; she remarked; &quot;you can go. But come after you've had your evening meal, and I'll then tell you about it. Just now there are visitors here; and besides, I don't feel in the humour.&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Jung thereupon retired with gentle step.</p>
<p>Old goody Liu, by this time, felt more composed in body and heart. &quot;I've to-day brought your nephew,&quot; she then explained, &quot;not for anything else, but because his father and mother haven't at home so much as anything to eat; the weather besides is already cold, so that I had no help but to take your nephew along and come to you, old friend, for assistance!&quot;</p>
<p>As she uttered these words, she again pushed Pan Erh forward. &quot;What did your father at home tell you to say?&quot; she asked of him; &quot;and what did he send us over here to do? Was it only to give our minds to eating fruit?&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng had long ago understood what she meant to convey, and finding that she had no idea how to express herself in a decent manner, she readily interrupted her with a smile. &quot;You needn't mention anything,&quot; she observed, &quot;I'm well aware of how things stand;&quot; and addressing herself to Mrs. Chou, she inquired, &quot;Has this old lady had breakfast, yes or no?&quot;</p>
<p>Old goody Liu hurried to explain. &quot;As soon as it was daylight,&quot; she proceeded, &quot;we started with all speed on our way here, and had we even so much as time to have any breakfast?&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng promptly gave orders to send for something to eat. In a short while Chou Jui's wife had called for a table of viands for the guests, which was laid in the room on the eastern side, and then came to take goody Liu and Pan Erh over to have their repast.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear Mrs. Chou,&quot; enjoined lady Feng, &quot;give them all they want, as I can't attend to them myself;&quot; which said, they hastily passed over into the room on the eastern side.</p>
<p>Lady Feng having again called Mrs. Chou, asked her: &quot;When you first informed madame about them, what did she say?&quot; &quot;Our Lady observed,&quot; replied Chou Jui's wife, &quot;that they don't really belong to the same family; that, in former years, their grandfather was an official at the same place as our old master; that hence it came that they joined ancestors; that these few years there hasn't been much intercourse (between their family and ours); that some years back, whenever they came on a visit, they were never permitted to go empty-handed, and that as their coming on this occasion to see us is also a kind attention on their part, they shouldn't be slighted. If they've anything to say,&quot; (our lady continued), &quot;tell lady Secunda to do the necessary, and that will be right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't it strange!&quot; exclaimed lady Feng, as soon as she had heard the message; &quot;since we are all one family, how is it I'm not familiar even with so much as their shadow?&quot;</p>
<p>While she was uttering these words, old goody Liu had had her repast and come over, dragging Pan Erh; and, licking her lips and smacking her mouth, she expressed her thanks.</p>
