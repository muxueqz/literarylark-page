    <h1>4</h1>
    <p>Lady Feng smiled. &quot;Do pray sit down,&quot; she said, &quot;and listen to what I'm going to tell you. What you, old lady, meant a little while back to convey, I'm already as much as yourself well acquainted with! Relatives, as we are, we shouldn't in fact have waited until you came to the threshold of our doors, but ought, as is but right, to have attended to your needs. But the thing is that, of late, the household affairs are exceedingly numerous, and our lady, advanced in years as she is, couldn't at a moment, it may possibly be, bethink herself of you all! What's more, when I took over charge of the management of the menage, I myself didn't know of all these family connections! Besides, though to look at us from outside everything has a grand and splendid aspect, people aren't aware that large establishments have such great hardships, which, were we to recount to others, they would hardly like to credit as true. But since you've now come from a great distance, and this is the first occasion that you open your mouth to address me, how can I very well allow you to return to your home with empty hands! By a lucky coincidence our lady gave, yesterday, to the waiting-maids, twenty taels to make clothes with, a sum which they haven't as yet touched, and if you don't despise it as too little, you may take it home as a first instalment, and employ it for your wants.&quot;</p>
<p>When old goody Liu heard the mention made by lady Feng of their hardships, she imagined that there was no hope; but upon hearing her again speak of giving her twenty taels, she was exceedingly delighted, so much so that her eyebrows dilated and her eyes gleamed with smiles.</p>
<p>&quot;We too know,&quot; she smilingly remarked, &quot;all about difficulties! but the proverb says, 'A camel dying of leanness is even bigger by much than a horse!' No matter what those distresses may be, were you yet to pluck one single hair from your body, my old friend, it would be stouter than our own waist.&quot;</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife stood by, and on hearing her make these coarse utterances, she did all she could to give her a hint by winking, and make her desist. Lady Feng laughed and paid no heed; but calling P'ing Erh, she bade her fetch the parcel of money, which had been given to them the previous day, and to also bring a string of cash; and when these had been placed before goody Liu's eyes: &quot;This is,&quot; said lady Feng, &quot;silver to the amount of twenty taels, which was for the time given to these young girls to make winter clothes with; but some other day, when you've nothing to do, come again on a stroll, in evidence of the good feeling which should exist between relatives. It's besides already late, and I don't wish to detain you longer and all for no purpose; but, on your return home, present my compliments to all those of yours to whom I should send them.&quot;</p>
<p>As she spake, she stood up. Old goody Liu gave utterance to a thousand and ten thousand expressions of gratitude, and taking the silver and cash, she followed Chou Jui's wife on her way to the out-houses. &quot;Well, mother dear,&quot; inquired Mrs. Chou, &quot;what did you think of my lady that you couldn't speak; and that whenever you opened your mouth it was all 'your nephew.' I'll make just one remark, and I don't mind if you do get angry. Had he even been your kindred nephew, you should in fact have been somewhat milder in your language; for that gentleman, Mr. Jung, is her kith and kin nephew, and whence has appeared such another nephew of hers (as Pan Erh)?&quot;</p>
<p>Old goody Liu smiled. &quot;My dear sister-in-law,&quot; she replied, &quot;as I gazed upon her, were my heart and eyes, pray, full of admiration or not? and how then could I speak as I should?&quot;</p>
<p>As they were chatting, they reached Chou Jui's house. They had been sitting for a while, when old goody Liu produced a piece of silver, which she was purposing to leave behind, to be given to the young servants in Chou Jui's house to purchase fruit to eat; but how could Mrs. Chou satiate her eye with such a small piece of silver? She was determined in her refusal to accept it, so that old goody Liu, after assuring her of her boundless gratitude, took her departure out of the back gate she had come in from.</p>
<p>Reader, you do not know what happened after old goody Liu left, but listen to the explanation which will be given in the next chapter.</p>

<p>  Presentation of artificial flowers made in the Palace.<br>
  Chia Lien disports himself with Hsi-feng.<br>
  Pao-yü meets Ch'in Chung at a family party.\</p>
<p>To resume our narrative. Chou Jui's wife having seen old goody Liu off, speedily came to report the visit to madame Wang; but, contrary to her expectation, she did not find madame Wang in the drawing-room; and it was after inquiring of the waiting-maids that she eventually learnt that she had just gone over to have a chat with &quot;aunt&quot; Hsüeh. Mrs. Chou, upon hearing this, hastily went out by the eastern corner door, and through the yard on the east, into the Pear Fragrance Court.</p>
<p>As soon as she reached the entrance, she caught sight of madame Wang's waiting-maid, Chin Ch'uan-erh, playing about on the terrace steps, with a young girl, who had just let her hair grow. When they saw Chou Jui's wife approach, they forthwith surmised that she must have some message to deliver, so they pursed up their lips and directed her to the inner-room. Chou Jui's wife gently raised the curtain-screen, and upon entering discovered madame Wang, in voluble conversation with &quot;aunt&quot; Hsüeh, about family questions and people in general.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chou did not venture to disturb them, and accordingly came into the inner room, where she found Hsüeh Pao-ch'ai in a house dress, with her hair simply twisted into a knot round the top of the head, sitting on the inner edge of the stove-couch, leaning on a small divan table, in the act of copying a pattern for embroidery, with the waiting-maid Ying Erh. When she saw her enter, Pao Ch'ai hastily put down her pencil, and turning round with a face beaming with smiles, &quot;Sister Chou,&quot; she said, &quot;take a seat.&quot;</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife likewise promptly returned the smile.</p>
<p>&quot;How is my young lady?&quot; she inquired, as she sat down on the edge of the couch. &quot;I haven't seen you come over on the other side for two or three days! Has Mr. Pao-yü perhaps given you offence?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What an idea!&quot; exclaimed Pao Ch'ai, with a smile. &quot;It's simply that<br>
I've had for the last couple of days my old complaint again, and that<br>
I've in consequence kept quiet all this time, and looked after myself.&quot;\</p>
<p>&quot;Is that it?&quot; asked Chou Jui's wife; &quot;but after all, what rooted kind of complaint are you subject to, miss? you should lose really no time in sending for a doctor to diagnose it, and give you something to make you all right. With your tender years, to have an organic ailment is indeed no trifle!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao Ch'ai laughed when she heard these remarks.</p>
<p>&quot;Pray,&quot; she said, &quot;don't allude to this again; for this ailment of mine I've seen, I can't tell you, how many doctors; taken no end of medicine and spent I don't know how much money; but the more we did so, not the least little bit of relief did I see. Lucky enough, we eventually came across a bald-pated bonze, whose speciality was the cure of nameless illnesses. We therefore sent for him to see me, and he said that I had brought this along with me from the womb as a sort of inflammatory virus, that luckily I had a constitution strong and hale so that it didn't matter; and that it would be of no avail if I took pills or any medicines. He then told me a prescription from abroad, and gave me also a packet of a certain powder as a preparative, with a peculiar smell and strange flavour. He advised me, whenever my complaint broke out, to take a pill, which would be sure to put me right again. And this has, after all, strange to say, done me a great deal of good.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of prescription is this one from abroad, I wonder,&quot; remarked Mrs. Chou; &quot;if you, miss, would only tell me, it would be worth our while bearing it in mind, and recommending it to others: and if ever we came across any one afflicted with this disease, we would also be doing a charitable deed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'd better not ask for the prescription,&quot; rejoined Pao Ch'ai smiling. &quot;Why, its enough to wear one out with perplexity! the necessaries and ingredients are few, and all easy to get, but it would be difficult to find the lucky moment! You want twelve ounces of the pollen of the white peone, which flowers in spring, twelve ounces of the pollen of the white summer lily, twelve ounces of the pollen of the autumn hibiscus flower, and twelve ounces of the white plum in bloom in the winter. You take the four kinds of pollen, and put them in the sun, on the very day of the vernal equinox of the succeeding year to get dry, and then you mix them with the powder and pound them well together. You again want twelve mace of water, fallen on 'rain water' day&hellip;..&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good gracious!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Chou promptly, as she laughed. &quot;From all you say, why you want three years' time! and what if no rain falls on 'rain water' day! What would one then do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so!&quot; Pao Ch'ai remarked smilingly; &quot;how can there be such an opportune rain on that very day! but to wait is also the best thing, there's nothing else to be done. Besides, you want twelve mace of dew, collected on 'White Dew' day, and twelve mace of the hoar frost, gathered on 'Frost Descent' day, and twelve mace of snow, fallen on 'Slight Snow' day! You next take these four kinds of waters and mix them with the other ingredients, and make pills of the size of a lungngan. You keep them in an old porcelain jar, and bury them under the roots of some flowers; and when the ailment betrays itself, you produce it and take a pill, washing it down with two candareens of a yellow cedar decoction.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;O-mi-to-fu!&quot; cried Mrs. Chou, when she heard all this, bursting out laughing. &quot;It's really enough to kill one! you might wait ten years and find no such lucky moments!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunate for me, however,&quot; pursued Pao Ch'ai, &quot;in the course of a year or two, after the bonze had told me about this prescription, we got all the ingredients; and, after much trouble, we compounded a supply, which we have now brought along with us from the south to the north; and lies at present under the pear trees.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Has this medicine any name or other of its own?&quot; further inquired Mrs.<br>
Chou.\</p>
<p>&quot;It has a name,&quot; replied Pao Ch'ai; &quot;the mangy-headed bonze also told it me; he called it 'cold fragrance' pill.&quot;</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife nodded her head, as she heard these words. &quot;What do you feel like after all when this complaint manifests itself?&quot; she went on to ask.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing much,&quot; replied Pao Ch'ai; &quot;I simply pant and cough a bit; but after I've taken a pill, I get over it, and it's all gone.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chou was bent upon making some further remark, when madame Wang was suddenly heard to enquire, &quot;Who is in here?&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chou went out hurriedly and answered; and forthwith told her all about old goody Liu's visit. Having waited for a while, and seeing that madame Wang had nothing to say, she was on the point of retiring, when &quot;aunt&quot; Hsueh unexpectedly remarked smiling: &quot;Wait a bit! I've something to give you to take along with you.&quot;</p>
<p>And as she spoke, she called for Hsiang Ling. The sound of the screen-board against the sides of the door was heard, and in walked the waiting-maid, who had been playing with Chin Ch'uan-erh. &quot;Did my lady call?&quot; she asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring that box of flowers,&quot; said Mrs. Hsueh.</p>
<p>Hsiang Ling assented, and brought from the other side a small embroidered silk box.</p>
<p>&quot;These,&quot; explained &quot;aunt&quot; Hsüeh, &quot;are a new kind of flowers, made in the palace. They consist of twelve twigs of flowers of piled gauze. I thought of them yesterday, and as they will, the pity is, only get old, if uselessly put away, why not give them to the girls to wear them in their hair! I meant to have sent them over yesterday, but I forgot all about them. You come to-day most opportunely, and if you will take them with you, I shall have got them off my hands. To the three young ladies in your family give two twigs each, and of the six that will remain give a couple to Miss Lin, and the other four to lady Feng.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Better keep them and give them to your daughter Pao Ch'ai to wear,&quot; observed madame Wang, &quot;and have done with it; why think of all the others?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't know, sister,&quot; replied &quot;aunt&quot; Hsüeh, &quot;what a crotchety thing<br>
Pao Ch'ai is! she has no liking for flower or powder.&quot;\</p>
<p>With these words on her lips, Chou Jui's wife took the box and walked out of the door of the room. Perceiving that Chin Ch'uan-erh was still sunning herself outside, Chou Jui's wife asked her: &quot;Isn't this Hsiang Ling, the waiting-maid that we've often heard of as having been purchased just before the departure of the Hsüeh family for the capital, and on whose account there occurred some case of manslaughter or other?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it's she,&quot; replied Chin Ch'uan. But as they were talking, they saw Hsiang Ling draw near smirkingly, and Chou Jui's wife at once seized her by the hand, and after minutely scrutinizing her face for a time, she turned round to Chin Ch'uan-erh and smiled. &quot;With these features she really resembles slightly the style of lady Jung of our Eastern Mansion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So I too maintain!&quot; said Chin Ch'uan-erh.</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife then asked Hsiang Ling, &quot;At what age did you enter this family? and where are your father and mother at present?&quot; and also inquired, &quot;In what year of your teens are you? and of what place are you a native?&quot;</p>
<p>But Hsiang Ling, after listening to all these questions, simply nodded her head and replied, &quot;I can't remember.&quot;</p>
<p>When Mrs. Chou and Chin Ch'uan-erh heard these words, their spirits changed to grief, and for a while they felt affected and wounded at heart; but in a short time, Mrs. Chou brought the flowers into the room at the back of madame Wang's principal apartment.</p>
<p>The fact is that dowager lady Chia had explained that as her granddaughters were too numerous, it would not be convenient to crowd them together in one place, that Pao-yü and Tai-yü should only remain with her in this part to break her loneliness, but that Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, and Hsi Ch'un, the three of them, should move on this side in the three rooms within the antechamber, at the back of madame lady Wang's quarters; and that Li Wan should be told off to be their attendant and to keep an eye over them.</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife, therefore, on this occasion came first to these rooms as they were on her way, but she only found a few waiting-maids assembled in the antechamber, waiting silently to obey a call.</p>
<p>Ying Ch'un's waiting-maid, Ssu Chi, together with Shih Shu, T'an Ch'un's waiting-maid, just at this moment raised the curtain, and made their egress, each holding in her hand a tea-cup and saucer; and Chou Jui's wife readily concluding that the young ladies were sitting together also walked into the inner room, where she only saw Ying Ch'un and T'an Ch'un seated near the window, in the act of playing chess. Mrs. Chou presented the flowers and explained whence they came, and what they were.</p>
<p>The girls forthwith interrupted their game, and both with a curtsey, expressed their thanks, and directed the waiting-maids to put the flowers away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chou complied with their wishes (and handing over the flowers); &quot;Miss Hsi Ch'un,&quot; she remarked, &quot;is not at home; and possibly she's over there with our old lady.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's in that room, isn't she?&quot; inquired the waiting-maids.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chou at these words readily came into the room on this side, where she found Hsi Ch'un, in company with a certain Chih Neng, a young nun of the &quot;moon reflected on water&quot; convent, talking and laughing together. On seeing Chou Jui's wife enter, Hsi Ch'un at once asked what she wanted, whereupon Chou Jui's wife opened the box of flowers, and explained who had sent them.</p>
<p>&quot;I was just telling Chih Neng,&quot; remarked Hsi Ch'un laughing, &quot;that I also purpose shortly shaving my head and becoming a nun; and strange enough, here you again bring me flowers; but supposing I shave my head, where can I wear them?&quot;</p>
<p>They were all very much amused for a time with this remark, and Hsi<br>
Ch'un told her waiting-maid, Ju Hua, to come and take over the flowers.\</p>
<p>&quot;What time did you come over?&quot; then inquired Mrs. Chou of Chih Neng.<br>
&quot;Where is that bald-pated and crotchety superior of yours gone?&quot;\</p>
<p>&quot;We came,&quot; explained Chih Neng, &quot;as soon as it was day; after calling upon madame Wang, my superior went over to pay a visit in the mansion of Mr. Yü, and told me to wait for her here.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Have you received,&quot; further asked Mrs. Chou, &quot;the monthly allowance for incense offering due on the fifteenth or not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't say,&quot; replied Chih Neng.</p>
<p>&quot;Who's now in charge of the issue of the monthly allowances to the various temples?&quot; interposed Hsi Ch'un, addressing Mrs. Chou, as soon as she heard what was said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's Yü Hsin,&quot; replied Chou Jui's wife, &quot;who's intrusted with the charge.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's how it is,&quot; observed Hsi Ch'un with a chuckle; &quot;soon after the arrival of the Superior, Yü Hsin's wife came over and kept on whispering with her for some time; so I presume it must have been about this allowance.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Chou then went on to bandy a few words with Chih Neng, after which she came over to lady Feng's apartments. Proceeding by a narrow passage, she passed under Li Wan's back windows, and went along the wall ornamented with creepers on the west. Going out of the western side gate, she entered lady Feng's court, and walked over into the Entrance Hall, where she only found the waiting-girl Feng Erh, sitting on the doorsteps of lady Feng's apartments.</p>
<p>When she caught sight of Mrs. Chou approaching, she at once waved her hand, bidding her go to the eastern room. Chou Jui's wife understood her meaning, and hastily came on tiptoe to the chamber on the east, where she saw a nurse patting lady Feng's daughter to sleep.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chou promptly asked the nurse in a low tone of voice: &quot;Is the young lady asleep at this early hour? But if even she is I must wake her up.&quot;</p>
<p>The nurse nodded her head in assent, but as these inquiries were being made, a sound of laughter came from over the other side, in which lady Feng's voice could be detected; followed, shortly after, by the sound of a door opening, and out came P'ing Erh, with a large brass basin in her hands, which she told Feng Erh to fill with water and take inside.</p>
<p>P'ing Erh forthwith entered the room on this side, and upon perceiving Chou Jui's wife: &quot;What have you come here again for, my old lady?&quot; she readily inquired.</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife rose without any delay, and handed her the box. &quot;I've come,&quot; said she, &quot;to bring you a present of flowers.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, P'ing Erh opened the box, and took out four sprigs, and, turning round, walked out of the room. In a short while she came from the inner room with two sprigs in her hand, and calling first of all Ts'ai Ming, she bade her take the flowers over to the mansion on the other side and present them to &quot;madame&quot; Jung, after which she asked Mrs. Chou to express her thanks on her return.</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife thereupon came over to dowager lady Chia's room on this side of the compound, and as she was going through the Entrance Hall, she casually came, face to face, with her daughter, got up in gala dress, just coming from the house of her mother-in-law.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you running over here for at this time?&quot; promptly inquired<br>
Mrs. Chou.\</p>
<p>&quot;Have you been well of late, mother?&quot; asked her daughter. &quot;I've been waiting for ever so long at home, but you never come out! What's there so pressing that has prevented you from returning home? I waited till I was tired, and then went on all alone, and paid my respects to our venerable lady; I'm now, on my way to inquire about our lady Wang. What errand haven't you delivered as yet, ma; and what is it you're holding?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ai! as luck would have it,&quot; rejoined Chou Jui's wife smilingly, &quot;old goody Liu came over to-day, so that besides my own hundred and one duties, I've had to run about here and there ever so long, and all for her! While attending to these, Mrs. Hsueh came across me, and asked me to take these flowers to the young ladies, and I've been at it up to this very moment, and haven't done yet! But coming at this time, you must surely have something or other that you want me to do for you! what's it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really ma, you're quick at guessing!&quot; exclaimed her daughter with a smile; &quot;I'll tell you what it's all about. The day before yesterday, your son-in-law had a glass of wine too many, and began altercating with some person or other; and some one, I don't know why, spread some evil report, saying that his antecedents were not clear, and lodged a charge against him at the Yamen, pressing the authorities to deport him to his native place. That's why I've come over to consult with you, as to whom we should appeal to, to do us this favour of helping us out of our dilemma!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I knew at once,&quot; Mrs. Chou remarked after listening, &quot;that there was something wrong; but this is nothing hard to settle! Go home and wait for me and I'll come straightway, as soon as I've taken these flowers to Miss Lin; our madame Wang and lady Secunda have both no leisure (to attend to you now,) so go back and wait for me! What's the use of so much hurry!&quot;</p>
<p>Her daughter, upon hearing this, forthwith turned round to go back, when she added as she walked away, &quot;Mind, mother, and make haste.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; replied Chou Jui's wife, &quot;of course I will; you are young yet, and without experience, and that's why you are in this flurry.&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, she betook herself into Tai-yü's apartments. Contrary to her expectation Tai-yü was not at this time in her own room, but in Pao-yü's; where they were amusing themselves in trying to solve the &quot;nine strung rings&quot; puzzle. On entering Mrs. Chou put on a smile. &quot;'Aunt' Hsüeh,&quot; she explained, &quot;has told me to bring these flowers and present them to you to wear in your hair.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What flowers?&quot; exclaimed Pao-yü. &quot;Bring them here and let me see them.&quot;</p>
<p>As he uttered these words, he readily stretched out his hands and took them over, and upon opening the box and looking in, he discovered, in fact, two twigs of a novel and artistic kind of artificial flowers, of piled gauze, made in the palace.</p>
<p>Tai-yü merely cast a glance at them, as Pao-yü held them. &quot;Have these flowers,&quot; she inquired eagerly, &quot;been sent to me alone, or have all the other girls got some too?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Each one of the young ladies has the same,&quot; replied Mrs. Chou; &quot;and these two twigs are intended for you, miss.&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü forced a smile. &quot;Oh! I see,&quot; she observed. &quot;If all the others hadn't chosen, even these which remain over wouldn't have been given to me.&quot;</p>
<p>Chou Jui's wife did not utter a word in reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Sister Chou, what took you over on the other side?&quot; asked Pao-yü.</p>
<p>&quot;I was told that our madame Wang was over there,&quot; explained Mrs. Chou, &quot;and as I went to give her a message, 'aunt' Hsüeh seized the opportunity to ask me to bring over these flowers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What was cousin Pao Ch'ai doing at home?&quot; asked Pao-yü. &quot;How is it she's not even been over for these few days?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's not quite well,&quot; remarked Mrs. Chou.</p>
<p>When Pao-yü heard this news, &quot;Who'll go,&quot; he speedily ascertained of the waiting-maids, &quot;and inquire after her? Tell her that cousin Lin and I have sent round to ask how our aunt and cousin are getting on! ask her what she's ailing from and what medicines she's taking, and explain to her that I know I ought to have gone over myself, but that on my coming back from school a short while back, I again got a slight chill; and that I'll go in person another day.&quot;</p>
<p>While Pao-yü was yet speaking, Hsi Hsüeh volunteered to take the message, and went off at once; and Mrs. Chou herself took her leave without another word.</p>
<p>Mrs. Chou's son-in-law was, in fact, Leng Tzu-hsing, the intimate friend of Yü-ts'un. Having recently become involved with some party in a lawsuit, on account of the sale of some curios, he had expressly charged his wife to come and sue for the favour (of a helping hand). Chou Jui's wife, relying upon her master's prestige, did not so much as take the affair to heart; and having waited till evening, she simply went over and requested lady Feng to befriend her, and the matter was forthwith ended.</p>
<p>When the lamps were lit, lady Feng came over, after having disrobed herself, to see madame Wang. &quot;I've already taken charge,&quot; she observed, &quot;of the things sent round to-day by the Chen family. As for the presents from us to them, we should avail ourselves of the return of the boats, by which the fresh delicacies for the new year were forwarded, to hand them to them to carry back.&quot;</p>
<p>Madame Wang nodded her head in token of approval.</p>
<p>&quot;The birthday presents,&quot; continued lady Feng, &quot;for lady Ling Ngan, the mother of the Earl of Ling Ngan, have already been got together, and whom will you depute to take them over?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;See,&quot; suggested madame Wang, &quot;who has nothing to do; let four maids go and all will be right! why come again and ask me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Our eldest sister-in-law Chen,&quot; proceeded lady Feng, &quot;came over to invite me to go to-morrow to their place for a little change. I don't think there will be anything for me to do to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whether there be or not,&quot; replied madame Wang, &quot;it doesn't matter; you must go, for whenever she comes with an invitation, it includes us, who are your seniors, so that, of course, it isn't such a pleasant thing for you; but as she doesn't ask us this time, but only asks you, it's evident that she's anxious that you should have a little distraction, and you mustn't disappoint her good intention. Besides it's certainly right that you should go over for a change.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng assented, and presently Li Wan, Ying Ch'un and the other cousins, likewise paid each her evening salutation and retired to their respective rooms, where nothing of any notice transpired.</p>
<p>The next day lady Feng completed her toilette, and came over first to tell madame Wang that she was off, and then went to say good-bye to dowager lady Chia; but when Pao-yü heard where she was going, he also wished to go; and as lady Feng had no help but to give in, and to wait until he had changed his clothes, the sister and brother-in-law got into a carriage, and in a short while entered the Ning mansion.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu, the wife of Chia Chen, and Mrs. Ch'in, the wife of Mr. Chia Jung, the two sisters-in-law, had, along with a number of maids, waiting-girls, and other servants, come as far as the ceremonial gate to receive them, and Mrs. Yu, upon meeting lady Feng, for a while indulged, as was her wont, in humorous remarks, after which, leading Pao-yü by the hand, they entered the drawing room and took their seats, Mrs. Ch'in handed tea round.</p>
<p>&quot;What have you people invited me to come here for?&quot; promptly asked lady Feng; &quot;if you have anything to present me with, hand it to me at once, for I've other things to attend to.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu and Mrs. Ch'in had barely any time to exchange any further remarks, when several matrons interposed, smilingly: &quot;Had our lady not come to-day, there would have been no help for it, but having come, you can't have it all your own way.&quot;</p>
<p>While they were conversing about one thing and another, they caught sight of Chia Jung come in to pay his respects, which prompted Pao-yü to inquire, &quot;Isn't my elder brother at home to-day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's gone out of town to-day,&quot; replied Mrs. Yu, &quot;to inquire after his grandfather. You'll find sitting here,&quot; she continued, &quot;very dull, and why not go out and have a stroll?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A strange coincidence has taken place to-day,&quot; urged Mrs. Ch'in, with a smile; &quot;some time back you, uncle Pao, expressed a wish to see my brother, and to-day he too happens to be here at home. I think he's in the library; but why not go and see for yourself, uncle Pao?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü descended at once from the stove-couch, and was about to go, when Mrs. Yu bade the servants to mind and go with him. &quot;Don't you let him get into trouble,&quot; she enjoined. &quot;It's a far different thing when he comes over under the charge of his grandmother, when he's all right.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If that be so,&quot; remarked lady Feng, &quot;why not ask the young gentleman to come in, and then I too can see him. There isn't, I hope, any objection to my seeing him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Never mind! never mind!&quot; observed Mrs. Yu, smilingly; &quot;it's as well that you shouldn't see him. This brother of mine is not, like the boys of our Chia family, accustomed to roughly banging and knocking about. Other people's children are brought up politely and properly, and not in this vixenish style of yours. Why, you'd ridicule him to death!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I won't laugh at him then, that's all,&quot; smiled lady Feng; &quot;tell them to bring him in at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He's shy,&quot; proceeded Mrs. Ch'in, &quot;and has seen nothing much of the world, so that you are sure to be put out when you see him, sister.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What an idea!&quot; exclaimed lady Feng. &quot;Were he even No Cha himself, I'd like to see him; so don't talk trash; if, after all, you don't bring him round at once, I'll give you a good slap on the mouth.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I daren't be obstinate,&quot; answered Mrs. Ch'in smiling; &quot;I'll bring him round!&quot;</p>
<p>In a short while she did in fact lead in a young lad, who, compared with Pao-yü, was somewhat more slight but, from all appearances, superior to Pao-yü in eyes and eyebrows, (good looks), which were so clear and well-defined, in white complexion and in ruddy lips, as well as graceful appearance and pleasing manners. He was however bashful and timid, like a girl.</p>
<p>In a shy and demure way, he made a bow to lady Feng and asked after her health.</p>
<p>Lady Feng was simply delighted with him. &quot;You take a low seat next to him!&quot; she ventured laughingly as she first pushed Pao-yü back. Then readily stooping forward, she took this lad by the hand and asked him to take a seat next to her. Presently she inquired about his age, his studies and such matters, when she found that at school he went under the name of Ch'in Chung.</p>
<p>The matrons and maids in attendance on lady Feng, perceiving that this was the first time their mistress met Ch'in Chung, (and knowing) that she had not at hand the usual presents, forthwith ran over to the other side and told P'ing Erh about it.</p>
<p>P'ing Erh, aware of the close intimacy that existed between lady Feng and Mrs. Ch'in, speedily took upon herself to decide, and selecting a piece of silk, and two small gold medals, (bearing the wish that he should attain) the highest degree, the senior wranglership, she handed them to the servants who had come over, to take away.</p>
<p>Lady Feng, however, explained that her presents were too mean by far, but Mrs. Ch'in and the others expressed their appreciation of them; and in a short time the repast was over, and Mrs. Yu, lady Feng and Mrs. Ch'in played at dominoes, but of this no details need be given; while both Pao-yü and Ch'in Chung sat down, got up and talked, as they pleased.</p>
<p>Since he had first glanced at Ch'in Chung, and seen what kind of person he was, he felt at heart as if he had lost something, and after being plunged in a dazed state for a time, he began again to give way to foolish thoughts in his mind.</p>
<p>&quot;There are then such beings as he in the world!&quot; he reflected. &quot;I now see there are! I'm however no better than a wallowing pig or a mangy cow! Despicable destiny! why was I ever born in this household of a marquis and in the mansion of a duke? Had I seen the light in the home of some penniless scholar, or poverty-stricken official, I could long ago have enjoyed the communion of his friendship, and I would not have lived my whole existence in vain! Though more honourable than he, it is indeed evident that silk and satins only serve to swathe this rotten trunk of mine, and choice wines and rich meats only to gorge the filthy drain and miry sewer of this body of mine! Wealth! and splendour! ye are no more than contaminated with pollution by me!&quot;</p>
<p>Ever since Ch'in Chung had noticed Pao-yü's unusual appearance, his sedate deportment, and what is more, his hat ornamented with gold, and his dress full of embroidery, attended by beautiful maids and handsome youths, he did not indeed think it a matter of surprise that every one was fond of him.</p>
<p>&quot;Born as I have had the misfortune to be,&quot; he went on to commune within himself, &quot;in an honest, though poor family, how can I presume to enjoy his companionship! This is verily a proof of what a barrier poverty and wealth set between man and man. What a serious misfortune is this too in this mortal world!&quot;</p>
<p>In wild and inane ideas of the same strain, indulged these two youths!</p>
<p>Pao-yü by and by further asked of him what books he was reading, and Ch'in Chung, in answer to these inquiries, told him the truth. A few more questions and answers followed; and after about ten remarks, a greater intimacy sprang up between them.</p>
<p>Tea and fruits were shortly served, and while they were having their tea, Pao-yü suggested, &quot;We two don't take any wine, and why shouldn't we have our fruit served on the small couch inside, and go and sit there, and thus save you all the trouble?&quot;</p>
<p>The two of them thereupon came into the inner apartment to have their tea; and Mrs. Ch'in attended to the laying out of fruit and wines for lady Feng, and hurriedly entered the room and hinted to Pao-yü: &quot;Dear uncle Pao, your nephew is young, and should he happen to say anything disrespectful, do please overlook it, for my sake, for though shy, he's naturally of a perverse and wilful disposition, and is rather given to having his own way.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Off with you!&quot; cried Pao-yü laughing; &quot;I know it all.&quot; Mrs. Ch'in then went on to give a bit of advice to her brother, and at length came to keep lady Feng company. Presently lady Feng and Mrs. Yu sent another servant to tell Pao-yü that there was outside of everything they might wish to eat and that they should mind and go and ask for it; and Pao-yü simply signified that they would; but his mind was not set upon drinking or eating; all he did was to keep making inquiries of Ch'in Chung about recent family concerns.</p>
<p>Ch'in Chung went on to explain that his tutor had last year relinquished his post, that his father was advanced in years and afflicted with disease, and had multifarious public duties to preoccupy his mind, so that he had as yet had no time to make arrangements for another tutor, and that all he did was no more than to keep up his old tasks; that as regards study, it was likewise necessary to have the company of one or two intimate friends, as then only, by dint of a frequent exchange of ideas and opinions, one could arrive at progress; and Pao-yü gave him no time to complete, but eagerly urged, &quot;Quite so! But in our household, we have a family school, and those of our kindred who have no means sufficient to engage the services of a tutor are at liberty to come over for the sake of study, and the sons and brothers of our relatives are likewise free to join the class. As my own tutor went home last year, I am now also wasting my time doing nothing; my father's intention was that I too should have gone over to this school, so that I might at least temporarily keep up what I have already read, pending the arrival of my tutor next year, when I could again very well resume my studies alone at home. But my grandmother raised objections; maintaining first of all, that the boys who attend the family classes being so numerous, she feared we would be sure to be up to mischief, which wouldn't be at all proper; and that, in the second place, as I had been ill for some time, the matter should be dropped, for the present. But as, from what you say, your worthy father is very much exercised on this score, you should, on your return, tell him all about it, and come over to our school. I'll also be there as your schoolmate; and as you and I will reap mutual benefit from each other's companionship, won't it be nice!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;When my father was at home the other day,&quot; Ch'in Chung smiled and said, &quot;he alluded to the question of a tutor, and explained that the free schools were an excellent institution. He even meant to have come and talked matters over with his son-in-law's father about my introduction, but with the urgent concerns here, he didn't think it right for him to come about this small thing, and make any trouble. But if you really believe that I might be of use to you, in either grinding the ink, or washing the slab, why shouldn't you at once make the needful arrangements, so that neither you nor I may idle our time? And as we shall be able to come together often and talk matters over, and set at the same time our parents' minds at ease, and to enjoy the pleasure of friendship, won't it be a profitable thing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Compose your mind!&quot; suggested Pao-yü. &quot;We can by and by first of all, tell your brother-in-law, and your sister as well as sister-in-law Secunda Lien; and on your return home to-day, lose no time in explaining all to your worthy father, and when I get back, I'll speak to my grandmother; and I can't see why our wishes shouldn't speedily be accomplished.&quot;</p>
<p>By the time they had arrived at this conclusion, the day was far advanced, and the lights were about to be lit; and they came out and watched them once more for a time as they played at dominoes. When they came to settle their accounts Mrs. Ch'in and Mrs. Yu were again the losers and had to bear the expense of a theatrical and dinner party; and while deciding that they should enjoy this treat the day after the morrow, they also had the evening repast.</p>
<p>Darkness having set in, Mrs. Yu gave orders that two youths should accompany Mr. Ch'in home. The matrons went out to deliver the directions, and after a somewhat long interval, Ch'in Chung said goodbye and was about to start on his way.</p>
<p>&quot;Whom have you told off to escort him?&quot; asked Mrs. Yu.</p>
<p>&quot;Chiao Ta,&quot; replied the matrons, &quot;has been told to go, but it happens that he's under the effects of drink and making free use again of abusive language.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu and Mrs. Chin remonstrated. &quot;What's the use,&quot; they said, &quot;of asking him? that mean fellow shouldn't be chosen, but you will go again and provoke him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People always maintain,&quot; added lady Feng, &quot;that you are far too lenient. But fancy allowing servants in this household to go on in this way; why, what will be the end of it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't mean to tell me,&quot; observed Mrs. Yu, &quot;that you don't know this Chiao Ta? Why, even the gentlemen one and all pay no heed to his doings! your eldest brother, Chia Cheng, he too doesn't notice him. It's all because when he was young he followed our ancestor in three or four wars, and because on one occasion, by extracting our senior from the heap of slain and carrying him on his back, he saved his life. He himself suffered hunger and stole food for his master to eat; they had no water for two days; and when he did get half a bowl, he gave it to his master, while he himself had sewage water. He now simply presumes upon the sentimental obligations imposed by these services. When the seniors of the family still lived, they all looked upon him with exceptional regard; but who at present ventures to interfere with him? He is also advanced in years, and doesn't care about any decent manners; his sole delight is wine; and when he gets drunk, there isn't a single person whom he won't abuse. I've again and again told the stewards not to henceforward ask Chiao Ta to do any work whatever, but to treat him as dead and gone; and here he's sent again to-day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can I not know all about this Chiao Ta?&quot; remarked lady Feng; &quot;but the secret of all this trouble is, that you won't take any decisive step. Why not pack him off to some distant farm, and have done with him?&quot; And as she spoke, &quot;Is our carriage ready?&quot; she went on to inquire.</p>
<p>&quot;All ready and waiting,&quot; interposed the married women.</p>
<p>Lady Feng also got up, said good-bye, and hand in hand with Pao-yü, they walked out of the room, escorted by Mrs. Yu and the party, as far as the entrance of the Main Hall, where they saw the lamps shedding a brilliant light and the attendants all waiting on the platforms. Chiao Ta, however, availing himself of Chia Chen's absence from home, and elated by wine, began to abuse the head steward Lai Erh for his injustice.</p>
<p>&quot;You bully of the weak and coward with the strong,&quot; he cried, &quot;when there's any pleasant charge, you send the other servants, but when it's a question of seeing any one home in the dark, then you ask me, you disorderly clown! a nice way you act the steward, indeed! Do you forget that if Mr. Chiao Ta chose to raise one leg, it would be a good deal higher than your head! Remember please, that twenty years ago, Mr. Chiao Ta wouldn't even so much as look at any one, no matter who it was; not to mention a pack of hybrid creatures like yourselves!&quot;</p>
<p>While he went on cursing and railing with all his might, Chia Jung appeared walking by lady Feng's carriage. All the servants having tried to hush him and not succeeding, Chia Jung became exasperated; and forthwith blew him up for a time. &quot;Let some one bind him up,&quot; he cried, &quot;and tomorrow, when he's over the wine, I'll call him to task, and we'll see if he won't seek death.&quot;</p>
<p>Chiao Ta showed no consideration for Chia Jung. On the contrary, he shouted with more vigour. Going up to Chia Jung: &quot;Brother Jung,&quot; he said, &quot;don't put on the airs of a master with Chiao Ta. Not to speak of a man such as you, why even your father and grandfather wouldn't presume to display such side with Chiao Ta. Were it not for Chiao Ta, and him alone, where would your office, honours, riches and dignity be? Your ancestor, whom I brought back from the jaws of death, heaped up all this estate, but up to this very day have I received no thanks for the services I rendered! on the contrary, you come here and play the master; don't say a word more, and things may come right; but if you do, I'll plunge the blade of a knife white in you and extract it red.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng, from inside the carriage, remarked to Chia Jung: &quot;Don't you yet pack off this insolent fellow! Why, if you keep him in your house, won't he be a source of mischief? Besides, were relatives and friends to hear about these things, won't they have a laugh at our expense, that a household like ours should be so devoid of all propriety?&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Jung assented. The whole band of servants finding that Chiao Ta was getting too insolent had no help but to come up and throw him over, and binding him up, they dragged him towards the stables. Chiao Ta abused even Chia Chen with still more vehemence, and shouted in a boisterous manner. &quot;I want to go,&quot; he cried, &quot;to the family Ancestral Temple and mourn my old master. Who would have ever imagined that he would leave behind such vile creatures of descendants as you all, day after day indulging in obscene and incestuous practices, 'in scraping of the ashes' and in philandering with brothers-in-law. I know all about your doings; the best thing is to hide one's stump of an arm in one's sleeve!&quot; (wash one's dirty clothes at home).</p>
<p>The servants who stood by, upon hearing this wild talk, were quite at their wits' end, and they at once seized him, tied him up, and filled his mouth to the fullest extent with mud mixed with some horse refuse.</p>
<p>Lady Feng and Chia Jung heard all he said from a distance, but pretended not to hear; but Pao-yü, seated in the carriage as he was, also caught this extravagant talk and inquired of lady Feng: &quot;Sister, did you hear him say something about 'scraping of the ashes?' What's it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't talk such rubbish!&quot; hastily shouted lady Feng; &quot;it was the maudlin talk of a drunkard! A nice boy you are! not to speak of your listening, but you must also inquire! wait and I'll tell your mother and we'll see if she doesn't seriously take you to task.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü was in such a state of fright that he speedily entreated her to forgive him. &quot;My dear sister,&quot; he craved, &quot;I won't venture again to say anything of the kind&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear brother, if that be so, it's all right!&quot; rejoined lady Feng reassuringly; &quot;on our return we'll speak to her venerable ladyship and ask her to send some one to arrange matters in the family school, and invite Ch'in Chung to come to school for his studies.&quot;</p>
<p>While yet this conversation was going on, they arrived at the Jung<br>
Mansion.\</p>

<p>  By a strange coincidence, Chia Pao-yü becomes acquainted with the<br>
      golden clasp.<br>
  In an unexpected meeting, Hsüeh Pao-ch'ai sees the jade of spiritual<br>
      perception.\</p>
<p>Pao-yü and lady Feng, we will now explain, paid, on their return home, their respects to all the inmates, and Pao-yü availed himself of the first occasion to tell dowager lady Chia of his wish that Ch'in Chung should come over to the family school. &quot;The presence for himself of a friend as schoolmate would,&quot; he argued, &quot;be fitly excellent to stir him to zeal,&quot; and he went on to speak in terms of high praise of Ch'in Chung, his character and his manners, which most of all made people esteem him.</p>
<p>Lady Feng besides stood by him and backed his request. &quot;In a day or two,&quot; she added, &quot;Ch'in Chung will be coming to pay his obeisance to your venerable ladyship.&quot;</p>
<p>This bit of news greatly rejoiced the heart of dowager lady Chia, and lady Feng likewise did not let the opportunity slip, without inviting the old lady to attend the theatrical performance to come off the day after the morrow. Dowager lady Chia was, it is true, well on in years, but was, nevertheless, very fond of enjoyment, so that when the day arrived and Mrs. Yu came over to invite her round, she forthwith took madame Wang, Lin Tai-yü, Pao-yü and others along and went to the play.</p>
<p>It was about noon, when dowager lady Chia returned to her apartments for her siesta; and madame Wang, who was habitually partial to a quiet life, also took her departure after she had seen the old lady retire. Lady Feng subsequently took the seat of honour; and the party enjoyed themselves immensely till the evening, when they broke up.</p>
<p>But to return to Pao-yü. Having accompanied his grandmother Chia back home, and waited till her ladyship was in her midday sleep, he had in fact an inclination to return to the performance, but he was afraid lest he should be a burden to Mrs. Ch'in and the rest and lest they should not feel at ease. Remembering therefore that Pao Ch'ai had been at home unwell for the last few days, and that he had not been to see her, he was anxious to go and look her up, but he dreaded that if he went by the side gate, at the back of the drawing-room, he would be prevented by something or other, and fearing, what would be making matters worse, lest he should come across his father, he consequently thought it better to go on his way by a detour. The nurses and waiting-maids thereupon came to help him to change his clothes; but they saw him not change, but go out again by the second door. These nurses and maids could not help following him out; but they were still under the impression that he was going over to the other mansion to see the theatricals. Contrary to their speculations, upon reaching the entrance hall, he forthwith went to the east, then turned to the north, and walking round by the rear of the hall, he happened to come face to face with two of the family companions, Mr. Ch'an Kuang, and Mr. Tan T'ing-jen. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yü, they both readily drew up to him, and as they smiled, the one put his arm round his waist, while the other grasped him by the hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh divine brother!&quot; they both exclaimed, &quot;this we call dreaming a pleasant dream, for it's no easy thing to come across you!&quot;</p>
<p>While continuing their remarks they paid their salutations, and inquired after his health; and it was only after they had chatted for ever so long, that they went on their way. The nurse called out to them and stopped them, &quot;Have you two gentlemen,&quot; she said, &quot;come out from seeing master?&quot;</p>
<p>They both nodded assent. &quot;Your master,&quot; they explained, &quot;is in the Meng P'o Chai small library having his siesta; so that you can go through there with no fear.&quot;</p>
<p>As they uttered these words, they walked away.</p>
<p>This remark also evoked a smile from Pao-yü, but without further delay he turned a corner, went towards the north, and came into the Pear Fragrance Court, where, as luck would have it, he met the head manager of the Household Treasury, Wu Hsin-teng, who, in company with the head of the granary, Tai Liang, and several other head stewards, seven persons in all, was issuing out of the Account Room.</p>
<p>On seeing Pao-yü approaching, they, in a body, stood still, and hung down their arms against their sides. One of them alone, a certain butler, called Ch'ien Hua, promptly came forward, as he had not seen Pao-yü for many a day, and bending on one knee, paid his respects to Pao-yü. Pao-yü at once gave a smile and pulled him up.</p>
<p>&quot;The day before yesterday,&quot; smiled all the bystanders, &quot;we were somewhere together and saw some characters written by you, master Secundus, in the composite style. The writing is certainly better than it was before! When will you give us a few sheets to stick on the wall?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where did you see them?&quot; inquired Pao-yü, with a grin.</p>
<p>&quot;They are to be found in more than one place,&quot; they replied, &quot;and every one praises them very much, and what's more, asks us for a few.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are not worth having,&quot; observed Pao-yü smilingly; &quot;but if you do want any, tell my young servants and it will be all right.&quot;</p>
<p>As he said these words, he moved onwards. The whole party waited till he had gone by, before they separated, each one to go his own way.</p>
<p>But we need not dilate upon matters of no moment, but return to Pao-yü.</p>
<p>On coming to the Pear Fragrance Court, he entered, first, into &quot;aunt&quot; Hsüeh's room, where he found her getting some needlework ready to give to the waiting-maids to work at. Pao-yü forthwith paid his respects to her, and &quot;aunt&quot; Hsüeh, taking him by the hand, drew him towards her and clasped him in her embrace.</p>
<p>&quot;With this cold weather,&quot; she smilingly urged, &quot;it's too kind of you, my dear child, to think of coming to see me; come along on the stove-couch at once!&mdash;Bring some tea,&quot; she continued, addressing the servants, &quot;and make it as hot as it can be!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Isn't Hsüeh P'an at home?&quot; Pao-yü having inquired: &quot;He's like a horse without a halter,&quot; Mrs. Hsüeh remarked with a sigh; &quot;he's daily running here and there and everywhere, and nothing can induce him to stay at home one single day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is sister (Pao Ch'ai) all right again?&quot; asked Pao-yü. &quot;Yes,&quot; replied Mrs. Hsüeh, &quot;she's well again. It was very kind of you two days ago to again think of her, and send round to inquire after her. She's now in there, and you can go and see her. It's warmer there than it's here; go and sit with her inside, and, as soon as I've put everything away, I'll come and join you and have a chat.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü, upon hearing this, jumped down with alacrity from the stove-couch, and walked up to the door of the inner room, where he saw hanging a portière somewhat the worse for use, made of red silk. Pao-yü raised the portière and making one step towards the interior, he found Pao Ch'ai seated on the couch, busy over some needlework. On the top of her head was gathered, and made into a knot, her chevelure, black as lacquer, and glossy like pomade. She wore a honey-coloured wadded robe, a rose-brown short-sleeved jacket, lined with the fur of the squirrel of two colours: the &quot;gold and silver;&quot; and a jupe of leek-yellow silk. Her whole costume was neither too new, neither too old, and displayed no sign of extravagance.</p>
<p>Her lips, though not rouged, were naturally red; her eyebrows, though not pencilled, were yet blue black; her face resembled a silver basin, and her eyes, juicy plums. She was sparing in her words, chary in her talk, so much so that people said that she posed as a simpleton. She was quiet in the acquittal of her duties and scrupulous as to the proper season for everything. &quot;I practise simplicity,&quot; she would say of herself.</p>
<p>&quot;How are you? are you quite well again, sister?&quot; inquired Pao-yü, as he gazed at her; whereupon Pao Ch'ai raised her head, and perceiving Pao-yü walk in, she got up at once and replied with a smile, &quot;I'm all right again; many thanks for your kindness in thinking of me.&quot;</p>
<p>While uttering this, she pressed him to take a seat on the stove-couch, and as he sat down on the very edge of the couch, she told Ying Erh to bring tea and asked likewise after dowager lady Chia and lady Feng. &quot;And are all the rest of the young ladies quite well?&quot; she inquired.</p>
<p>Saying this she scrutinised Pao-yü, who she saw had a head-dress of purplish-gold twisted threads, studded with precious stones. His forehead was bound with a gold circlet, representing two dragons, clasping a pearl. On his person he wore a light yellow, archery-sleeved jacket, ornamented with rampant dragons, and lined with fur from the ribs of the silver fox; and was clasped with a dark sash, embroidered with different-coloured butterflies and birds. Round his neck was hung an amulet, consisting of a clasp of longevity, a talisman of recorded name, and, in addition to these, the precious jade which he had had in his mouth at the time of his birth.</p>
<p>&quot;I've daily heard every one speak of this jade,&quot; said Pao Ch'ai with a smile, &quot;but haven't, after all, had an opportunity of looking at it closely, but anyhow to-day I must see it.&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, she drew near. Pao-yü himself approached, and taking it from his neck, he placed it in Pao Ch'ai's hand. Pao Ch'ai held it in her palm. It appeared to her very much like the egg of a bird, resplendent as it was like a bright russet cloud; shiny and smooth like variegated curd and covered with a net for the sake of protection.</p>
<p>Readers, you should know that this was the very block of useless stone which had been on the Ta Huang Hills, and which had dropped into the Ch'ing Keng cave, in a state of metamorphosis. A later writer expresses his feelings in a satirical way as follows:</p>
<p>  Nü Wo's fusion of stones was e'er a myth inane,<br>
  But from this myth hath sprung fiction still more insane!<br>
  Lost is the subtle life, divine, and real!&mdash;gone!<br>
  Assumed, mean subterfuge! foul bags of skin and bone!<br>
  Fortune, when once adverse, how true! gold glows no more!<br>
  In evil days, alas! the jade's splendour is o'er!<br>
  Bones, white and bleached, in nameless hill-like mounds are flung,<br>
  Bones once of youths renowned and maidens fair and young.\</p>
<p>The rejected stone has in fact already given a record of the circumstances of its transformation, and the inscription in seal characters, engraved upon it by the bald-headed bonze, and below will now be also appended a faithful representation of it; but its real size is so very diminutive, as to allow of its being held by a child in his mouth while yet unborn, that were it to have been drawn in its exact proportions, the characters would, it is feared, have been so insignificant in size, that the beholder would have had to waste much of his eyesight, and it would besides have been no pleasant thing.</p>
<p>While therefore its shape has been adhered to, its size has unavoidably been slightly enlarged, to admit of the reader being able, conveniently, to peruse the inscription, even by very lamplight, and though he may be under the influence of wine.</p>
<p>These explanations have been given to obviate any such sneering remarks as: &quot;What could be, pray, the size of the mouth of a child in his mother's womb, and how could it grasp such a large and clumsy thing?&quot;</p>
<p>On the face of the jade was written:</p>
<p>  Precious Gem of Spiritual Perception.<br>
  If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,<br>
  Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!\</p>
<p>On the reverse was written:</p>
<p>1 To exorcise evil spirits and the accessory visitations; 2 To cure predestined sickness; 3 To prognosticate weal and woe.</p>
<p>Pao Ch'ai having looked at the amulet, twisted it again to the face, and scrutinising it closely, read aloud:</p>
<p>  If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me,<br>
  Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee!\</p>
<p>She perused these lines twice, and, turning round, she asked Ying Erh laughingly: &quot;Why don't you go and pour the tea? what are you standing here like an idiot!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These two lines which I've heard,&quot; smiled Ying Erh, &quot;would appear to pair with the two lines on your necklet, miss!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!&quot; eagerly observed Pao-yü with a grin, when he caught these words, &quot;are there really eight characters too on your necklet, cousin? do let me too see it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't listen to what she says,&quot; remarked Pao Ch'ai, &quot;there are no characters on it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear cousin,&quot; pleaded Pao-yü entreatingly, &quot;how is it you've seen mine?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao Ch'ai was brought quite at bay by this remark of his, and she consequently added, &quot;There are also two propitious phrases engraved on this charm, and that's why I wear it every day. Otherwise, what pleasure would there be in carrying a clumsy thing.&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, she unfastened the button, and produced from inside her crimson robe, a crystal-like locket, set with pearls and gems, and with a brilliant golden fringe. Pao-yü promptly received it from her, and upon minute examination, found that there were in fact four characters on each side; the eight characters on both sides forming two sentences of good omen. The similitude of the locket is likewise then given below. On the face of the locket is written:</p>
<p>&quot;Part not from me and cast me not away;&quot;</p>
<p>And on the reverse:</p>
<p>&quot;And youth, perennial freshness will display!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü examined the charm, and having also read the inscription twice over aloud, and then twice again to himself, he said as he smiled, &quot;Dear cousin, these eight characters of yours form together with mine an antithetical verse.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They were presented to her,&quot; ventured Ying Erh, &quot;by a mangy-pated bonze, who explained that they should be engraved on a golden trinket&hellip;.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao Ch'ai left her no time to finish what she wished to say, but speedily called her to task for not going to bring the tea, and then inquired of Pao-yü &quot;Where he had come from?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü had, by this time, drawn quite close to Pao Ch'ai, and perceived whiff after whiff of some perfume or other, of what kind he could not tell. &quot;What perfume have you used, my cousin,&quot; he forthwith asked, &quot;to fumigate your dresses with? I really don't remember smelling any perfumery of the kind before.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very averse,&quot; replied Pao Ch'ai blandly, &quot;to the odour of fumigation; good clothes become impregnated with the smell of smoke.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In that case,&quot; observed Pao-yü, &quot;what scent is it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I remember,&quot; Pao Ch'ai answered, after some reflection; &quot;it's the scent of the 'cold fragrance' pills which I took this morning.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What are these cold fragrance pills,&quot; remarked Pao-yü smiling, &quot;that they have such a fine smell? Give me, cousin, a pill to try.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here you are with your nonsense again,&quot; Pao Ch'ai rejoined laughingly; &quot;is a pill a thing to be taken recklessly?&quot;</p>
<p>She had scarcely finished speaking, when she heard suddenly some one outside say, &quot;Miss Lin is come;&quot; and shortly Lin Tai-yü walked in in a jaunty manner.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I come at a wrong moment!&quot; she exclaimed forthwith, smirking significantly when she caught sight of Pao-yü.</p>
<p>Pao-yü and the rest lost no time in rising and offering her a seat, whereupon Pao Ch'ai added with a smile, &quot;How can you say such things?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Had I known sooner,&quot; continued Tai-yü, &quot;that he was here, I would have kept away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can't fathom this meaning of yours,&quot; protested Pao Ch'ai.</p>
<p>&quot;If one comes,&quot; Tai-yü urged smiling, &quot;then all come, and when one doesn't come, then no one comes. Now were he to come to-day, and I to come to-morrow, wouldn't there be, by a division of this kind, always some one with you every day? and in this way, you wouldn't feel too lonely, nor too crowded. How is it, cousin, that you didn't understand what I meant to imply?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it snowing?&quot; inquired Pao-yü, upon noticing that she wore a cloak made of crimson camlet, buttoning in front.</p>
<p>&quot;It has been snowing for some time,&quot; ventured the matrons, who were standing below. &quot;Fetch my wrapper!&quot; Pao-yü remarked, and Tai-yü readily laughed. &quot;Am I not right? I come, and, of course, he must go at once.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Did I ever mention that I was going?&quot; questioned Pao-yü; &quot;I only wish it brought to have it ready when I want it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a snowy day,&quot; consequently remarked Pao-yü's nurse, dame Li, &quot;and we must also look to the time, but you had better remain here and amuse yourself with your cousin. Your aunt has, in there, got ready tea and fruits. I'll tell the waiting-maid to go and fetch your wrapper and the boys to return home.&quot; Pao-yü assented, and nurse Li left the room and told the boys that they were at liberty to go.</p>
<p>By this time Mrs. Hsüeh had prepared tea and several kinds of nice things and kept them all to partake of those delicacies. Pao-yü, having spoken highly of some goose feet and ducks' tongues he had tasted some days before, at his eldest sister-in-law's, Mrs. Yu's, &quot;aunt&quot; Hsüeh promptly produced several dishes of the same kind, made by herself, and gave them to Pao-yü to try. &quot;With a little wine,&quot; added Pao-yü with a smile, &quot;they would be first rate.&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Hsüeh thereupon bade the servants fetch some wine of the best quality; but dame Li came forward and remonstrated. &quot;My lady,&quot; she said, &quot;never mind the wine.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü smilingly pleaded: &quot;My nurse, I'll take just one cup and no more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's no use,&quot; nurse Li replied, &quot;were your grandmother and mother present, I wouldn't care if you drank a whole jar. I remember the day when I turned my eyes away but for a moment, and some ignorant fool or other, merely with the view of pandering for your favour, gave you only a drop of wine to drink, and how this brought reproaches upon me for a couple of days. You don't know, my lady, you have no idea of his disposition! it's really dreadful; and when he has had a little wine he shows far more temper. On days when her venerable ladyship is in high spirits, she allows him to have his own way about drinking, but he's not allowed to have wine on any and every day; and why should I have to suffer inside and all for nothing at all?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You antiquated thing!&quot; replied Mrs. Hsüeh laughing, &quot;set your mind at ease, and go and drink your own wine! I won't let him have too much, and should even the old lady say anything, let the fault be mine.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, she asked a waiting-maid to take nurse Li along with her and give her also a glass of wine so as to keep out the cold air.</p>
<p>When nurse Li heard these words, she had no alternative but to go for a time with all the others and have some wine to drink.</p>
<p>&quot;The wine need not be warmed: I prefer it cold!&quot; Pao-yü went on to suggest meanwhile.</p>
<p>&quot;That won't do,&quot; remonstrated Mrs. Hsüeh; &quot;cold wine will make your hand tremble when you write.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have,&quot; interposed Pao Ch'ai smiling, &quot;the good fortune, cousin Pao-yü, of having daily opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of every kind of subject, and yet don't you know that the properties of wine are mostly heating? If you drink wine warm, its effects soon dispel, but if you drink it cold, it at once congeals in you; and as upon your intestines devolves the warming of it, how can you not derive any harm? and won't you yet from this time change this habit of yours? leave off at once drinking that cold wine.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü finding that the words he had heard contained a good deal of sense, speedily put down the cold wine, and having asked them to warm it, he at length drank it.</p>
<p>Tai-yü was bent upon cracking melon seeds, saying nothing but simply pursing up her lips and smiling, when, strange coincidence, Hsüeh Yen, Tai-yü's waiting-maid, walked in and handed her mistress a small hand-stove.</p>
<p>&quot;Who told you to bring it?&quot; ascertained Tai-yü grinningly. &quot;I'm sorry to have given whoever it is the trouble; I'm obliged to her. But did she ever imagine that I would freeze to death?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tzu Chuan was afraid,&quot; replied Hsüeh Yen, &quot;that you would, miss, feel cold, and she asked me to bring it over.&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü took it over and held it in her lap. &quot;How is it,&quot; she smiled, &quot;that you listen to what she tells you, but that you treat what I say, day after day, as so much wind blowing past your ears! How is it that you at once do what she bids you, with even greater alacrity than you would an imperial edict?&quot;</p>
<p>When Pao-yü heard this, he felt sure in his mind that Tai-yü was availing herself of this opportunity to make fun of him, but he made no remark, merely laughing to himself and paying no further notice. Pao Ch'ai, again, knew full well that this habit was a weak point with Tai-yü, so she too did not go out of her way to heed what she said.</p>
<p>&quot;You've always been delicate and unable to stand the cold,&quot; interposed &quot;aunt&quot; Hsüeh, &quot;and is it not a kind attention on their part to have thought of you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't know, aunt, how it really stands,&quot; responded Tai-yü smilingly; &quot;fortunately enough, it was sent to me here at your quarters; for had it been in any one else's house, wouldn't it have been a slight upon them? Is it forsooth nice to think that people haven't so much as a hand-stove, and that one has fussily to be sent over from home? People won't say that the waiting-maids are too officious, but will imagine that I'm in the habit of behaving in this offensive fashion.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're far too punctilious,&quot; remarked Mrs. Hsüeh, &quot;as to entertain such notions! No such ideas as these crossed my mind just now.&quot;</p>
<p>While they were conversing, Pao-yü had taken so much as three cups of wine, and nurse Li came forward again to prevent him from having any more. Pao-yü was just then in a state of exultation and excitement, (a state) enhanced by the conversation and laughter of his cousins, so that was he ready to agree to having no more! But he was constrained in a humble spirit to entreat for permission. &quot;My dear nurse,&quot; he implored, &quot;I'll just take two more cups and then have no more.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You'd better be careful,&quot; added nurse Li, &quot;your father is at home to-day, and see that you're ready to be examined in your lessons.&quot;</p>
<p>When Pao-yü heard this mention, his spirits at once sank within him, and gently putting the wine aside, he dropped his head upon his breast.</p>
<p>Tai-yü promptly remonstrated. &quot;You've thrown cold water,&quot; she said, &quot;over the spirits of the whole company; why, if uncle should ask to see you, well, say that aunt Hsüeh detained you. This old nurse of yours has been drinking, and again makes us the means of clearing her muddled head!&quot;</p>
<p>While saying this, she gave Pao-yü a big nudge with the intent of stirring up his spirits, adding, as she addressed him in a low tone of voice: &quot;Don't let us heed that old thing, but mind our own enjoyment.&quot;</p>
<p>Dame Li also knew very well Tai-yü's disposition, and therefore remarked: &quot;Now, Miss Lin, don't you urge him on; you should after all, give him good advice, as he may, I think, listen to a good deal of what you say to him.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why should I urge him on?&quot; rejoined Lin Tai-yü, with a sarcastic smile, &quot;nor will I trouble myself to give him advice. You, old lady, are far too scrupulous! Old lady Chia has also time after time given him wine, and if he now takes a cup or two more here, at his aunt's, lady Hsüeh's house, there's no harm that I can see. Is it perhaps, who knows, that aunt is a stranger in this establishment, and that we have in fact no right to come over here to see her?&quot;</p>
<p>Nurse Li was both vexed and amused by the words she had just heard. &quot;Really,&quot; she observed, &quot;every remark this girl Lin utters is sharper than a razor! I didn't say anything much!&quot;</p>
