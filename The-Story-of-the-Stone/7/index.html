    <h1>6</h1>
    <p>&quot;Why need you be so modest?&quot; observed Chia Chen; &quot;Doctor, do please walk in at once to see our son's wife, for I look up, with full reliance, to your lofty intelligence to dispel my solicitude!&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Jung forthwith walked in with him. When they reached the inner apartment, and he caught sight of Mrs. Ch'in, he turned round and asked Chia Jung, &quot;This is your honourable spouse, isn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; assented Chia Jung; &quot;but please, Doctor, take a seat, and let me tell you the symptoms of my humble wife's ailment, before her pulse be felt. Will this do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mean idea is,&quot; remarked the Doctor, &quot;that it would, after all, be better that I should begin by feeling her pulse, before I ask you to inform me what the source of the ailment is. This is the first visit I pay to your honourable mansion; besides, I possess no knowledge of anything; but as our worthy Mr. Feng would insist upon my coming over to see you, I had in consequence no alternative but to come. After I have now made a diagnosis, you can judge whether what I say is right or not, before you explain to me the phases of the complaint during the last few days, and we can deliberate together upon some prescription; as to the suitableness or unsuitableness of which your honourable father will then have to decide, and what is necessary will have been done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor,&quot; rejoined Chia Jung, &quot;you are indeed eminently clear sighted; all I regret at present is that we have met so late! But please, Doctor, diagnose the state of the pulse, so as to find out whether there be hope of a cure or not; if a cure can be effected, it will be the means of allaying the solicitude of my father and mother.&quot;</p>
<p>The married women attached to that menage forthwith presented a pillow; and as it was being put down for Mrs. Ch'in to rest her arm on, they raised the lower part of her sleeve so as to leave her wrist exposed. The Doctor thereupon put out his hand and pressed it on the pulse of the right hand. Regulating his breath (to the pulsation) so as to be able to count the beatings, he with due care and minuteness felt the action for a considerable time, when, substituting the left hand, he again went through the same operation.</p>
<p>&quot;Let us go and sit outside,&quot; he suggested, after he had concluded feeling her pulses. Chia Jung readily adjourned, in company with the Doctor, to the outer apartment, where they seated themselves on the stove-couch. A matron having served tea; &quot;Please take a cup of tea, doctor,&quot; Chia Jung observed. When tea was over, &quot;Judging,&quot; he inquired, &quot;Doctor, from the present action of the pulses, is there any remedy or not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The action of the pulse, under the forefinger, on the left hand of your honorable spouse,&quot; proceeded the Doctor, &quot;is deep and agitated; the left hand pulse, under the second finger, is deep and faint. The pulse, under the forefinger, of the right hand, is gentle and lacks vitality. The right hand pulse, under my second finger, is superficial, and has lost all energy. The deep and agitated beating of the forepulse of the left hand arises from the febrile state, due to the weak action of the heart. The deep and delicate condition of the second part of the pulse of the left wrist, emanates from the sluggishness of the liver, and the scarcity of the blood in that organ. The action of the forefinger pulse, of the right wrist, is faint and lacks strength, as the breathing of the lungs is too weak. The second finger pulse of the right wrist is superficial and devoid of vigour, as the spleen must be affected injuriously by the liver. The weak action of the heart, and its febrile state, should be the natural causes which conduce to the present irregularity in the catamenia, and insomnia at night; the poverty of blood in the liver, and the sluggish condition of that organ must necessarily produce pain in the ribs; while the overdue of the catamenia, the cardiac fever, and debility of the respiration of the lungs, should occasion frequent giddiness in the head, and swimming of the eyes, the certain recurrence of perspiration between the periods of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7, and the sensation of being seated on board ship. The obstruction of the spleen by the liver should naturally create distaste for liquid or food, debility of the vital energies and prostration of the four limbs. From my diagnosis of these pulses, there should exist these various symptoms, before (the pulses and the symptoms can be said) to harmonise. But should perchance (any doctor maintain) that this state of the pulses imports a felicitous event, your servant will not presume to give an ear to such an opinion!&quot;</p>
<p>A matron, who was attached as a personal attendant (to Mrs. Ch'in,) and who happened to be standing by interposed: &quot;How could it be otherwise?&quot; she ventured. &quot;In real truth, Doctor, you speak like a supernatural being, and there's verily no need for us to say anything! We have now, ready at hand, in our household, a good number of medical gentlemen, who are in attendance upon her, but none of these are proficient enough to speak in this positive manner. Some there are who say that it's a genital complaint; others maintain that it's an organic disease. This doctor explains that there is no danger: while another, again, holds that there's fear of a crisis either before or after the winter solstice; but there is, in one word, nothing certain said by them. May it please you, sir, now to favour us with your clear directions.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This complaint of your lady's,&quot; observed the Doctor, &quot;has certainly been neglected by the whole number of doctors; for had a treatment with certain medicines been initiated at the time of the first occurrence of her habitual sickness, I cannot but opine that, by this time, a perfect cure would have been effected. But seeing that the organic complaint has now been, through neglect, allowed to reach this phase, this calamity was, in truth, inevitable. My ideas are that this illness stands, as yet, a certain chance of recovery, (three chances out of ten); but we will see how she gets on, after she has had these medicines of mine. Should they prove productive of sleep at night, then there will be added furthermore two more chances in the grip of our hands. From my diagnosis, your lady is a person, gifted with a preëminently excellent, and intelligent disposition; but an excessive degree of intelligence is the cause of frequent contrarieties; and frequent contrarieties give origin to an excessive amount of anxious cares. This illness arises from the injury done, by worrying and fretting, to the spleen, and from the inordinate vigour of the liver; hence it is that the relief cannot come at the proper time and season. Has not your lady, may I ask, heretofore at the period of the catamenia, suffered, if indeed not from anaemia, then necessarily from plethora? Am I right in assuming this or not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure she did,&quot; replied the matron; &quot;but she has never been subject to anaemia, but to a plethora, varying from either two to three days, and extending, with much irregularity, to even ten days.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so!&quot; observed the Doctor, after hearing what she had to say, &quot;and this is the source of this organic illness! Had it in past days been treated with such medicine as could strengthen the heart, and improve the respiration, would it have reached this stage? This has now overtly made itself manifest in an ailment originating from the paucity of water and the vigour of fire; but let me make use of some medicines, and we'll see how she gets on!&quot;</p>
<p>There and then he set to work and wrote a prescription, which he handed to Chia Jung, the purpose of which was: Decoction for the improvement of respiration, the betterment of the blood, and the restoration of the spleen. Ginseng, Atractylodes Lancea; Yunnan root; Prepared Ti root; Aralia edulis; Peony roots; Levisticum from Sze Ch'uan; Sophora tormentosa; Cyperus rotundus, prepared with rice; Gentian, soaked in vinegar; Huai Shan Yao root; Real &quot;O&quot; glue; Carydalis Ambigua; and Dried liquorice. Seven Fukien lotus seeds, (the cores of which should be extracted,) and two large zizyphi to be used as a preparative.</p>
<p>&quot;What exalted intelligence!&quot; Chia Jung, after perusing it, exclaimed. &quot;But I would also ask you, Doctor, to be good enough to tell me whether this illness will, in the long run, endanger her life or not?&quot;</p>
<p>The Doctor smiled. &quot;You, sir, who are endowed with most eminent intelligence (are certain to know) that when a human illness has reached this phase, it is not a derangement of a day or of a single night; but after these medicines have been taken, we shall also have to watch the effect of the treatment! My humble opinion is that, as far as the winter of this year goes, there is no fear; in fact, after the spring equinox, I entertain hopes of a complete cure.&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Jung was likewise a person with all his wits about him, so that he did not press any further minute questions.</p>
<p>Chia Jung forthwith escorted the Doctor and saw him off, and taking the prescription and the diagnosis, he handed them both to Chia Chen for his perusal, and in like manner recounted to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu all that had been said on the subject.</p>
<p>&quot;The other doctors have hitherto not expressed any opinions as positive as this one has done,&quot; observed Mrs. Yu, addressing herself to Chia Chen, &quot;so that the medicines to be used are, I think, surely the right ones!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He really isn't a man,&quot; rejoined Chia Chen, &quot;accustomed to give much of his time to the practice of medicine, in order to earn rice for his support: and it's Feng Tzu-ying, who is so friendly with us, who is mainly to be thanked for succeeding, after ever so much trouble, in inducing him to come. But now that we have this man, the illness of our son's wife may, there is no saying, stand a chance of being cured. But on that prescription of his there is ginseng mentioned, so you had better make use of that catty of good quality which was bought the other day.&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Jung listened until the conversation came to a close, after which he left the room, and bade a servant go and buy the medicines, in order that they should be prepared and administered to Mrs. Ch'in.</p>
<p>What was the state of Mrs. Ch'in's illness, after she partook of these medicines, we do not know; but, reader, listen to the explanation given in the chapter which follows.</p>

<p>  In honour of Chia Ching's birthday, a family banquet is spread in the<br>
      Ning Mansion.<br>
  At the sight of Hsi-feng, Chia Jui entertains feelings of licentious<br>
      love.\</p>
<p>We will now explain, in continuation of our story, that on the day of Chia Ching's birthday, Chia Chen began by getting ready luscious delicacies and rare fruits, which he packed in sixteen spacious present boxes, and bade Chia Jung take them, along with the servants belonging to the household, over to Chia Ching.</p>
<p>Turning round towards Chia Jung: &quot;Mind,&quot; he said, &quot;that you observe whether your grandfather be agreeable or not, before you set to work and pay your obeisance! 'My father,' tell him, 'has complied with your directions, venerable senior, and not presumed to come over; but he has at home ushered the whole company of the members of the family (into your apartments), where they all paid their homage facing the side of honour.'&quot;</p>
<p>After Chia Jung had listened to these injunctions, he speedily led off the family domestics, and took his departure. During this interval, one by one arrived the guests. First came Chia Lien and Chia Se, who went to see whether the seats in the various places (were sufficient). &quot;Is there to be any entertainment or not?&quot; they also inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;Our master,&quot; replied the servants, &quot;had, at one time, intended to invite the venerable Mr. Chia Ching to come and spend this day at home, and hadn't for this reason presumed to get up any entertainment. But when the other day he came to hear that the old gentleman was not coming, he at once gave us orders to go in search of a troupe of young actors, as well as a band of musicians, and all these people are now engaged making their preparations on the stage in the garden.&quot;</p>
<p>Next came, in a group, mesdames Hsing and Wang, lady Feng and Pao-yü, followed immediately after by Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; Mrs. Yu's mother having already arrived and being in there in advance of her. Salutations were exchanged between the whole company, and they pressed one another to take a seat. Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu both handed the tea round.</p>
<p>&quot;Our venerable lady,&quot; they explained, as they smiled, &quot;is a worthy senior; while our father is, on the other hand, only her nephew; so that on a birthday of a man of his age, we should really not have had the audacity to invite her ladyship; but as the weather, at this time, is cool, and the chrysanthemums, in the whole garden, are in luxuriant blossom, we have requested our venerable ancestor to come for a little distraction, and to see the whole number of her children and grand-children amuse themselves. This was the object we had in view, but, contrary to our expectations, our worthy senior has not again conferred upon us the lustre of her countenance.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng did not wait until madame Wang could open her mouth, but took the initiative to reply. &quot;Our venerable lady,&quot; she urged, &quot;had, even so late as yesterday, said that she meant to come; but, in the evening, upon seeing brother Pao eating peaches, the mouth of the old lady once again began to water, and after partaking of a little more than the half of one, she had, about the fifth watch, to get out of bed two consecutive times, with the result that all the forenoon to-day, she felt her body considerably worn out. She therefore bade me inform our worthy senior that it was utterly impossible for her to come to-day; adding however that, if there were any delicacies, she fancied a few kinds, but that they should be very tender.&quot;</p>
<p>When Chia Chen heard these words, he smiled. &quot;Our dowager lady,&quot; he replied, &quot;is, I argued, so fond of amusement that, if she doesn't come to-day, there must, for a certainty, be some valid reason; and that's exactly what happens to be the case.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The other day I heard your eldest sister explain,&quot; interposed madame Wang, &quot;that Chia Jung's wife was anything but well; but what's after all the matter with her?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She has,&quot; observed Mrs. Yu, &quot;contracted this illness verily in a strange manner! Last moon at the time of the mid-autumn festival, she was still well enough to be able to enjoy herself, during half the night, in company with our dowager lady and madame Wang. On her return, she continued in good health, until after the twentieth, when she began to feel more and more languid every day, and loth, likewise, to eat anything; and this has been going on for well-nigh half a month and more; she hasn't besides been anything like her old self for two months.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;May she not,&quot; remarked madame Hsing, taking up the thread of the conversation, &quot;be ailing for some happy event?&quot;</p>
<p>But while she was uttering these words, some one from outside announced: &quot;Our senior master, second master and all the gentlemen of the family have come, and are standing in the Reception Hall!&quot; Whereupon Chia Chen and Chia Lien quitted the apartment with hurried step; and during this while, Mrs. Yu reiterated how that some time ago a doctor had also expressed the opinion that she was ailing for a happy event, but that the previous day, had come a doctor, recommended by Feng Tzu-ying&mdash;a doctor, who had from his youth up made medicine his study, and was very proficient in the treatment of diseases,&mdash;who asserted, after he had seen her, that it was no felicitous ailment, but that it was some grave complaint. &quot;It was only yesterday,&quot; (she explained,) &quot;that he wrote his prescription; and all she has had is but one dose, and already to-day the giddiness in the head is considerably better; as regards the other symptoms they have as yet shown no marked improvement.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I maintain,&quot; remarked lady Feng, &quot;that, were she not quite unfit to stand the exertion, would she in fact, on a day like this, be unwilling to strain every nerve and come round.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You saw her,&quot; observed Mrs. Yu, &quot;on the third in here; how that she bore up with a violent effort for ever so long, but it was all because of the friendship that exists between you two, that she still longed for your society, and couldn't brook the idea of tearing herself away.&quot;</p>
<p>When lady Feng heard these words, her eyes got quite red, and after a time she at length exclaimed: &quot;In the Heavens of a sudden come wind and rain; while with man, in a day and in a night, woe and weal survene! But with her tender years, if for a complaint like this she were to run any risk, what pleasure is there for any human being to be born and to sojourn in the world?&quot;</p>
<p>She was just speaking, when Chia Jung walked into the apartment; and after paying his respects to madame Hsing, madame Wang, and lady Feng, he then observed to Mrs. Yu: &quot;I have just taken over the eatables to our venerable ancestor; and, at the same time, I told him that my father was at home waiting upon the senior, and entertaining the junior gentlemen of the whole family, and that in compliance with grandfather's orders, he did not presume to go over. The old gentleman was much delighted by what he heard me say, and having signified that that was all in order, bade me tell father and you, mother, to do all you can in your attendance upon the senior gentlemen and ladies, enjoining me to entertain, with all propriety, my uncles, aunts, and my cousins. He also went on to urge me to press the men to cut, with all despatch, the blocks for the Record of Meritorious Deeds, and to print ten thousand copies for distribution. All these messages I have duly delivered to my father, but I must now be quick and go out, so as to send the eatables for the elder as well as for the younger gentlemen of the entire household.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brother Jung Erh,&quot; exclaimed lady Feng, &quot;wait a moment. How is your wife getting on? how is she, after all, to-day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not well,&quot; replied Chia Jung. &quot;But were you, aunt, on your return to go in and see her, you will find out for yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Jung forthwith left the room. During this interval, Mrs. Yu addressed herself to mesdames Hsing and Wang; &quot;My ladies,&quot; she asked, &quot;will you have your repast in here, or will you go into the garden for it? There are now in the garden some young actors engaged in making their preparations?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's better in here,&quot; madame Wang remarked, as she turned towards madame Hsing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu thereupon issued directions to the married women and matrons to be quick in serving the eatables. The servants, in waiting outside the door, with one voice signified their obedience; and each of them went off to fetch what fell to her share. In a short while, the courses were all laid out, and Mrs. Yu pressed mesdames Hsing and Wang, as well as her mother, into the upper seats; while she, together with lady Feng and Pao-yü, sat at a side table.</p>
<p>&quot;We've come,&quot; observed mesdames Hsing and Wang, &quot;with the original idea of paying our congratulations to our venerable senior on the occasion of his birthday; and isn't this as if we had come for our own birthdays?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The old gentleman,&quot; answered lady Feng, &quot;is a man fond of a quiet life; and as he has already consummated a process of purification, he may well be looked upon as a supernatural being, so that the purpose to which your ladyships have given expression may be considered as manifest to his spirit, upon the very advent of the intention.&quot;</p>
<p>As this sentence was uttered the whole company in the room burst out laughing. Mrs. Yu's mother, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and lady Feng having one and all partaken of the banquet, rinsed their mouths and washed their hands, which over, they expressed a wish to go into the garden.</p>
<p>Chia Jung entered the room. &quot;The senior gentlemen,&quot; he said to Mrs. Yu, &quot;as well as all my uncles and cousins, have finished their repast; but the elder gentleman Mr. Chia She, who excused himself on the score of having at home something to attend to, and Mr. Secundus (Chia Cheng), who is not partial to theatrical performances and is always afraid that people will be too boisterous in their entertainments, have both of them taken their departure. The rest of the family gentlemen have been taken over by uncle Secundus Mr. Lien, and Mr. Se, to the other side to listen to the play. A few moments back Prince Nan An, Prince Tung P'ing, Prince Hsi Ning, Prince Pei Ching, these four Princes, with Niu, Duke of Chen Kuo, and five other dukes, six in all, and Shih, Marquis of Chung Ching, and other seven, in all eight marquises, sent their messengers with their cards and presents. I have already told father all about it; but before I did so, the presents were put away in the counting room, the lists of presents were all entered in the book, and the 'received with thanks' cards were handed to the respective messengers of the various mansions; the men themselves were also tipped in the customary manner, and all of them were kept to have something to eat before they went on their way. But, mother, you should invite the two ladies, your mother and my aunt, to go over and sit in the garden.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Just so!&quot; observed Mrs. Yu, &quot;but we've only now finished our repast, and were about to go over.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I wish to tell you, madame,&quot; interposed lady Feng, &quot;that I shall go first and see brother Jung's wife and then come and join you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All right,&quot; replied madame Wang; &quot;we should all have been fain to have paid her a visit, did we not fear lest she should look upon our disturbing her with displeasure, but just tell her that we would like to know how she is getting on!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My dear sister,&quot; remarked Mrs. Yu, &quot;as our son's wife has a ready ear for all you say, do go and cheer her up, (and if you do so,) it will besides set my own mind at ease; but be quick and come as soon as you can into the garden.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü being likewise desirous to go along with lady Feng to see lady Ch'in, madame Wang remarked, &quot;Go and see her just for a while, and then come over at once into the garden; (for remember) she is your nephew's wife, (and you couldn't sit in there long).&quot;</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu forthwith invited mesdames Wang and Hsing, as well as her own mother, to adjourn to the other side, and they all in a body walked into the garden of Concentrated Fragrance; while lady Feng and Pao-yü betook themselves, in company with Chia Jung, over to this side.</p>
<p>Having entered the door, they with quiet step walked as far as the entrance of the inner chamber. Mrs. Ch'in, upon catching sight of them, was bent upon getting up; but &quot;Be quick,&quot; remonstrated lady Feng, &quot;and give up all idea of standing up; for take care your head will feel dizzy.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng hastened to make a few hurried steps forward and to grasp Mrs. Ch'in's hand in hers. &quot;My dear girl!&quot; she exclaimed; &quot;How is it that during the few days I've not seen you, you have grown so thin?&quot;</p>
<p>Readily she then took a seat on the rug, on which Mrs. Ch'in was seated, while Pao-yü, after inquiring too about her health, sat in the chair on the opposite side.</p>
<p>&quot;Bring the tea in at once,&quot; called out Chia Jung, &quot;for aunt and uncle<br>
Secundus have not had any tea in the drawing room.&quot;\</p>
<p>Mrs. Ch'in took lady Feng's hand in her own and forced a smile. &quot;This is all due to my lack of good fortune; for in such a family as this, my father and mother-in-law treat me just as if I were a daughter of their own flesh and blood! Besides, your nephew, (my husband,) may, it is true, my dear aunt, be young in years, but he is full of regard for me, as I have regard for him, and we have had so far no misunderstanding between us! In fact, among the senior generation, as well as that of the same age as myself, in the whole clan, putting you aside, aunt, about whom no mention need be made, there is not one who has not ever had anything but love for me, and not one who has not ever shown me anything but kindness! But since I've fallen ill with this complaint, all my energy has even every bit of it been taken out of me, so that I've been unable to show to my father and mother-in-law any mark of filial attention, yea so much as for one single day and to you, my dear aunt, with all this affection of yours for me, I have every wish to be dutiful to the utmost degree, but, in my present state, I'm really not equal to it; my own idea is, that it isn't likely that I shall last through this year.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü kept, while (she spoke,) his eyes fixed intently upon a picture on the opposite side, representing some begonias drooping in the spring time, and upon a pair of scrolls, with this inscription written by Ch'in Tai-hsü:</p>
<p>  A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man because the spring<br>
      is cold!<br>
  The fragrant whiff which wafts itself into man's nose, is the perfume<br>
      of wine!\</p>
<p>And he could not help recalling to mind his experiences at the time when he had fallen asleep in this apartment, and had, in his dream, visited the confines of the Great Void. He was just plunged in a state of abstraction, when he heard Mrs. Ch'in give utterance to these sentiments, which pierced his heart as if they were ten thousand arrows, (with the result that) tears unwittingly trickled from his eyes.</p>
<p>Lady Feng perceiving him in tears felt it extremely painful within herself to bear the sight; but she was on pins and needles lest the patient should detect their frame of mind, and feel, instead (of benefit), still more sore at heart, which would not, after all, be quite the purpose of her visit; which was to afford her distraction and consolation. &quot;Pao-yü,&quot; she therefore exclaimed, &quot;you are like an old woman! Ill, as she is, simply makes her speak in this wise, and how ever could things come to such a pass! Besides, she is young in years, so that after a short indisposition, her illness will get all right!&quot; &quot;Don't,&quot; she said as she turned towards Mrs. Ch'in, &quot;give way to silly thoughts and idle ideas! for by so doing won't you yourself be aggravating your ailment?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;All that her sickness in fact needs,&quot; observed Chia Jung, &quot;is, that she should be able to take something to eat, and then there will be nothing to fear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Brother Pao,&quot; urged lady Feng, &quot;your mother told you to go over, as soon as you could, so that don't stay here, and go on in the way you're doing, for you after all incite this lady also to feel uneasy at heart. Besides, your mother over there is solicitous on your account.&quot; &quot;You had better go ahead with your uncle Pao,&quot; she consequently continued, addressing herself to Chia Jung, &quot;while I sit here a little longer.&quot;</p>
<p>When Chia Jung heard this remark, he promptly crossed over with Pao-yü into the garden of Concentrated Fragrance, while lady Feng went on both to cheer her up for a time, and to impart to her, in an undertone, a good deal of confidential advice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Yu had despatched servants, on two or three occasions, to hurry lady Feng, before she said to Mrs. Ch'in: &quot;Do all you can to take good care of yourself, and I'll come and see you again. You're bound to get over this illness; and now, in fact, that you've come across that renowned doctor, you have really nothing more to fear.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He might,&quot; observed Mrs. Ch'in as she smiled, &quot;even be a supernatural being and succeed in healing my disease, but he won't be able to remedy my destiny; for, my dear aunt, I feel sure that with this complaint of mine, I can do no more than drag on from day to day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you encourage such ideas,&quot; remonstrated lady Feng, &quot;how can this illness ever get all right? What you absolutely need is to cast away all these notions, and then you'll improve. I hear moreover that the doctor asserts that if no cure be effected, the fear is of a change for the worse in spring, and not till then. Did you and I moreover belong to a family that hadn't the means to afford any ginseng, it would be difficult to say how we could manage to get it; but were your father and mother-in-law to hear that it's good for your recovery, why not to speak of two mace of ginseng a day, but even two catties will be also within their means! So mind you do take every care of your health! I'm now off on my way into the garden.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me, my dear aunt,&quot; added Mrs. Ch'in, &quot;that I can't go with you; but when you have nothing to do, I entreat you do come over and see me! and you and I can sit and have a long chat.&quot;</p>
<p>After lady Feng had heard these words, her eyes unwillingly got quite red again. &quot;When I'm at leisure I shall, of course,&quot; she rejoined, &quot;come often to see you;&quot; and forthwith leading off the matrons and married women, who had come over with her, as well as the women and matrons of the Ning mansion, she passed through the inner part of the house, and entered, by a circuitous way, the side gate of the park, when she perceived: yellow flowers covering the ground; white willows flanking the slopes; diminutive bridges spanning streams, resembling the Jo Yeh; zigzag pathways (looking as if) they led to the steps of Heaven; limpid springs dripping from among the rocks; flowers hanging from hedges emitting their fragrance, as they were flapped by the winds; red leaves on the tree tops swaying to and fro; groves picture-like, half stripped of foliage; the western breeze coming with sudden gusts, and the wail of the oriole still audible; the warm sun shining with genial rays, and the cicada also adding its chirp: structures, visible to the gaze at a distance in the South-east, soaring high on various sites and resting against the hills; three halls, visible near by on the North-west, stretching in one connected line, on the bank of the stream; strains of music filling the pavilion, imbued with an unwonted subtle charm; and maidens in fine attire penetrating the groves, lending an additional spell to the scene.</p>
<p>Lady Feng, while engaged in contemplating the beauties of the spot, advanced onwards step by step. She was plunged in a state of ecstasy, when suddenly, from the rear of the artificial rockery, egressed a person, who approached her and facing her said, &quot;My respects to you, sister-in-law.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng was so startled by this unexpected appearance that she drew back. &quot;Isn't this Mr. Jui?&quot; she ventured.</p>
<p>&quot;What! sister-in-law,&quot; exclaimed Chia Jui, &quot;don't you recognise even me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It isn't that I didn't recognise you,&quot; explained lady Feng, &quot;but at the sudden sight of you, I couldn't conceive that it would possibly be you, sir, in this place!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This was in fact bound to be,&quot; replied Chia Jui; &quot;for there's some subtle sympathy between me and you, sister-in-law. Here I just stealthily leave the entertainment, in order to revel for a while in this solitary place when, against every expectation, I come across you, sister-in-law; and isn't this a subtle sympathy?&quot;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he kept his gaze fixed on lady Feng, who being an intelligent person, could not but arrive, at the sight of his manner, at the whole truth in her surmises. &quot;It isn't to be wondered at,&quot; she consequently observed, as she smiled hypocritically, &quot;that your eldest brother should make frequent allusion to your qualities! for after seeing you on this occasion, and hearing you utter these few remarks, I have readily discovered what an intelligent and genial person you are! I am just now on my way to join the ladies on the other side, and have no leisure to converse with you; but wait until I've nothing to attend to, when we can meet again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I meant to have gone over to your place and paid my respects to you, sister-in-law,&quot; pleaded Chia Jui, &quot;but I was afraid lest a person of tender years like yourself mightn't lightly receive any visitors!&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng gave another sardonic smile. &quot;Relatives,&quot; she continued, &quot;of one family, as we are, what need is there to say anything of tender years?&quot;</p>
<p>After Chia Jui had heard these words, he felt his heart swell within him with such secret joy that he was urged to reflect: &quot;I have at length to-day, when least I expected it, obtained this remarkable encounter with her!&quot;</p>
<p>But as the display of his passion became still more repulsive, lady Feng urged him to go. &quot;Be off at once,&quot; she remarked, &quot;and join the entertainment; for mind, if they find you out, they will mulct you in so many glasses of wine!&quot;</p>
<p>By the time this suggestion had reached Chia Jui's ears, half of his body had become stiff like a log of wood; and as he betook himself away, with lothful step, he turned his head round to cast glances at her. Lady Feng purposely slackened her pace; and when she perceived that he had gone a certain distance, she gave way to reflection. &quot;This is indeed,&quot; she thought, &quot;knowing a person, as far as face goes, and not as heart! Can there be another such a beast as he! If he really continues to behave in this manner, I shall soon enough compass his death, with my own hands, and he'll then know what stuff I'm made of.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng, at this juncture moved onward, and after turning round a chain of hillocks, she caught sight of two or three matrons coming along with all speed. As soon as they espied lady Feng they put on a smile. &quot;Our mistress,&quot; they said, &quot;perceiving that your ladyship was not forthcoming, has been in a great state of anxiety, and bade your servants come again to request you to come over.</p>
<p>&quot;Is your mistress,&quot; observed lady Feng, &quot;so like a quick-footed demon?&quot;</p>
<p>While lady Feng advanced leisurely, she inquired, &quot;How many plays have been recited?&quot; to which question one of the matrons replied, &quot;They have gone through eight or nine.&quot; But while engaged in conversation, they had already reached the back door of the Tower of Celestial Fragrance, where she caught sight of Pao-yü playing with a company of waiting-maids and pages. &quot;Brother Pao,&quot; lady Feng exclaimed, &quot;don't be up to too much mischief!&quot; &quot;The ladies are all sitting upstairs,&quot; interposed one of the maids. &quot;Please, my lady, this is the way up.&quot;</p>
<p>At these words lady Feng slackened her pace, raised her dress, and walked up the stairs, where Mrs. Yu was already at the top of the landing waiting for her.</p>
<p>&quot;You two,&quot; remarked Mrs. Yu, smiling, &quot;are so friendly, that having met you couldn't possibly tear yourself away to come. You had better to-morrow move over there and take up your quarters with her and have done; but sit down and let me, first of all, present you a glass of wine.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng speedily drew near mesdames Hsing and Wang, and begged permission to take a seat; while Mrs. Yu brought the programme, and pressed lady Feng to mark some plays.</p>
<p>&quot;The senior ladies occupy the seats of honour,&quot; remonstrated lady Feng, &quot;and how can I presume to choose?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We, and our relative by marriage, have selected several plays,&quot; explained mesdames Hsing and Wang, &quot;and it's for you now to choose some good ones for us to listen to.&quot;</p>
<p>Standing up, lady Feng signified her obedience; and taking over the programme, and perusing it from top to bottom, she marked off one entitled, the &quot;Return of the Spirit,&quot; and another called &quot;Thrumming and Singing;&quot; after which she handed back the programme, observing, &quot;When they have done with the 'Ennoblement of two Officers,' which they are singing just at present, it will be time enough to sing these two.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of course it will,&quot; retorted madame Wang, &quot;but they should get it over as soon as they can, so as to allow your elder Brother and your Sister-in-law to have rest; besides, their hearts are not at ease.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You senior ladies don't come often,&quot; expostulated Mrs. Yu, &quot;and you and I will derive more enjoyment were we to stay a little longer; it's as yet early in the day!&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng stood up and looked downstairs. &quot;Where have all the gentlemen gone to?&quot; she inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;The gentlemen have just gone over to the Pavilion of Plenteous Effulgence,&quot; replied a matron, who stood by; &quot;they have taken along with them ten musicians and gone in there to drink their wine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't convenient for them,&quot; remarked lady Feng, &quot;to be over here; but who knows what they have again gone to do behind our backs?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Could every one,&quot; interposed Mrs. Yu, &quot;resemble you, a person of such propriety!&quot;</p>
<p>While they indulged in chatting and laughing, the plays they had chosen were all finished; whereupon the tables were cleared of the wines, and the repast was served. The meal over, the whole company adjourned into the garden, and came and sat in the drawing-room. After tea, they at length gave orders to get ready the carriages, and they took their leave of Mrs. Yu's mother. Mrs. Yu, attended by all the secondary wives, servants, and married women, escorted them out, while Chia Chen, along with the whole bevy of young men, stood by the vehicles, waiting in a group for their arrival.</p>
<p>After saluting mesdames Hsing and Wang, &quot;Aunts,&quot; they said, &quot;you must come over again to-morrow for a stroll.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We must be excused,&quot; observed madame Wang, &quot;we've sat here the whole day to-day, and are, after all, feeling quite tired; besides, we shall need to have some rest to-morrow.&quot;</p>
<p>Both of them thereupon got into their carriages and took their departure, while Chia Jui still kept a fixed gaze upon lady Feng; and it was after Chia Chen had gone in that Li Kuei led round the horse, and that Pao-yü mounted and went off, following in the track of mesdames Hsing and Wang.</p>
<p>Chia Chen and the whole number of brothers and nephews belonging to the family had, during this interval, partaken of their meal, and the whole party at length broke up. But in like manner, all the inmates of the clan and the guests spent on the morrow another festive day, but we need not advert to it with any minuteness.</p>
<p>After this occasion, lady Feng came in person and paid frequent visits to Mrs. Ch'in; but as there were some days on which her ailment was considerably better, and others on which it was considerably worse, Chia Chen, Mrs. Yu, and Chia Jung were in an awful state of anxiety.</p>
<p>Chia Jui, it must moreover be noticed, came over, on several instances, on a visit to the Jung mansion; but it invariably happened that he found that lady Feng had gone over to the Ning mansion.</p>
<p>This was just the thirtieth of the eleventh moon, the day on which the winter solstice fell; and the few days preceding that season, dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and lady Feng did not let one day go by without sending some one to inquire about Mrs. Ch'in; and as the servants, on their return, repeatedly reported that, during the last few days, neither had her ailment aggravated, nor had it undergone any marked improvement, madame Wang explained to dowager lady Chia, that as a complaint of this nature had reached this kind of season without getting any worse, there was some hope of recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course there is!&quot; observed the old lady; &quot;what a dear child she is! should anything happen to her, won't it be enough to make people die from grief!&quot; and as she spake she felt for a time quite sore at heart. &quot;You and she,&quot; continuing, she said to lady Feng, &quot;have been friends for ever so long; to-morrow is the glorious first (and you can't go), but after to-morrow you should pay her a visit and minutely scrutinise her appearance: and should you find her any better, come and tell me on your return! Whatever things that dear child has all along a fancy for, do send her round a few even as often as you can by some one or other!&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng assented to each of her recommendations; and when the second arrived, she came, after breakfast, to the Ning mansion to see how Mrs. Ch'in was getting on; and though she found her none the worse, the flesh all over her face and person had however become emaciated and parched up. She readily sat with Mrs. Ch'in for a long while, and after they had chatted on one thing and another, she again reiterated the assurances that this illness involved no danger, and distracted her for ever so long.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether I get well or not,&quot; observed Mrs. Ch'in, &quot;we'll know in spring; now winter is just over, and I'm anyhow no worse, so that possibly I may get all right; and yet there's no saying; but, my dear sister-in-law, do press our old lady to compose her mind! yesterday, her ladyship sent me some potato dumplings, with minced dates in them, and though I had two, they seem after all to be very easily digested!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll send you round some more to-morrow,&quot; lady Feng suggested; &quot;I'm now going to look up your mother-in-law, and will then hurry back to give my report to our dowager lady.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Please, sister-in-law,&quot; Mrs. Ch'in said, &quot;present my best respects to her venerable ladyship, as well as to madame Wang.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng signified that she would comply with her wishes, and, forthwith leaving the apartment, she came over and sat in Mrs. Yu's suite of rooms.</p>
<p>&quot;How do you, who don't see our son's wife very often, happen to find her?&quot; inquired Mrs. Yu.</p>
<p>Lady Feng drooped her head for some time. &quot;There's no help,&quot; she ventured, &quot;for this illness! but you should likewise make every subsequent preparation, for it would also be well if you could scour it away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've done so much as to secretly give orders,&quot; replied Mrs. Yu, &quot;to get things ready; but for that thing (the coffin), there's no good timber to be found, so that it will have to be looked after by and by.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng swallowed hastily a cup of tea, and after a short chat, &quot;I must be hurrying back,&quot; she remarked, &quot;to deliver my message to our dowager lady!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You should,&quot; urged Mrs. Yu, &quot;be sparse in what you tell her lady ship so as not to frighten an old person like her!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know well enough what to say,&quot; replied lady Feng.</p>
<p>Without any further delay, lady Feng then sped back. On her arrival at home she looked up the old lady. &quot;Brother Jung's wife,&quot; she explained, &quot;presents her compliments, and pays obeisance to your venerable ladyship; she says that she's much better, and entreats you, her worthy senior, to set your mind at ease! That as soon as she's a little better she will come and prostrate herself before your ladyship.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How do you find her?&quot; inquired dowager lady Chia.</p>
<p>&quot;For the present there's nothing to fear,&quot; continued lady Feng; &quot;for her mien is still good.&quot;</p>
<p>After the old lady had heard these words, she was plunged for a long while in deep reflection; and as she turned towards lady Feng, &quot;Go and divest yourself of your toilette,&quot; she said, &quot;and have some rest.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng in consequence signified her obedience, and walked away, returning home after paying madame Wang a visit. P'ing Erh helped lady Feng to put on the house costume, which she had warmed by the fire, and lady Feng eventually took a seat and asked &quot;whether there was anything doing at home?&quot;</p>
<p>P'ing Erh then brought the tea, and after going over to hand the cup: &quot;There's nothing doing,&quot; she replied; &quot;as regards the interest on the three hundred taels, Wang Erh's wife has brought it in, and I've put it away. Besides this, Mr. Jui sent round to inquire if your ladyship was at home or not, as he meant to come and pay his respects and to have a chat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Heng!&quot; exclaimed lady Feng at these words. &quot;Why should this beast compass his own death? we'll see when he comes what is to be done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why is this Mr. Jui so bent upon coming?' P'ing Erh having inquired, lady Feng readily gave her an account of how she had met him in the course of the ninth moon in the Ning mansion, and of what had been said by him.</p>
<p>&quot;What a mangy frog to be bent upon eating the flesh of a heavenly goose!&quot; ejaculated P'ing Erh. &quot;A stupid and disorderly fellow with no conception of relationship, to harbour such a thought! but we'll make him find an unnatural death!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wait till he comes,&quot; added lady Feng, &quot;when I feel certain I shall find some way.&quot;</p>
<p>What happened, however, when Chia Jui came has not, as yet, been ascertained, but listen, reader, to the explanation given in the next chapter.</p>

<p>  Wang Hsi-feng maliciously lays a trap for Chia Jui, under pretence<br>
      that his affection is reciprocated.<br>
  Chia T'ien-hsiang gazes at the face of the mirror of Voluptuousness.\</p>
<p>Lady Feng, it must be noticed in continuation of our narrative, was just engaged in talking with P'ing Erh, when they heard some one announce that Mr. Jui had come. Lady Feng gave orders that he should be invited to step in, and Chia Jui perceiving that he had been asked to walk in was at heart elated at the prospect of seeing her.</p>
<p>With a face beaming with smiles, Lady Feng inquired again and again how he was; and, with simulated tenderness she further pressed him to take a seat and urged him to have a cup of tea.</p>
<p>Chia Jui noticed how still more voluptuous lady Feng looked in her present costume, and, as his eyes burnt with love, &quot;How is it,&quot; he inquired, &quot;that my elder brother Secundus is not yet back?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What the reason is I cannot tell,&quot; lady Feng said by way of reply.</p>
<p>&quot;May it not be,&quot; Chia Jui smilingly insinuated, &quot;that some fair damsel has got hold of him on the way, and that he cannot brook to tear himself from her to come home?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That makes it plain that there are those among men who fall in love with any girl they cast their eyes on,&quot; hinted lady Feng.</p>
<p>&quot;Your remarks are, sister-in-law, incorrect, for I'm none of this kind!&quot;<br>
Chia Jui explained smirkingly.\</p>
<p>&quot;How many like you can there be!&quot; rejoined lady Feng with a sarcastic smile; &quot;in ten, not one even could be picked out!&quot;</p>
<p>When Chia Jui heard these words, he felt in such high glee that he rubbed his ears and smoothed his cheeks. &quot;My sister-in-law,&quot; he continued, &quot;you must of course be extremely lonely day after day.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Indeed I am,&quot; observed lady Feng, &quot;and I only wish some one would come and have a chat with me to break my dull monotony.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I daily have ample leisure,&quot; Chia Jui ventured with a simper, &quot;and wouldn't it be well if I came every day to dispel your dulness, sister-in-law?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You are simply fooling me,&quot; exclaimed lady Feng laughing. &quot;It isn't likely you would wish to come over here to me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If in your presence, sister-in-law, I utter a single word of falsehood, may the thunder from heaven blast me!&quot; protested Chia Jui. &quot;It's only because I had all along heard people say that you were a dreadful person, and that you cannot condone even the slightest shortcoming committed in your presence, that I was induced to keep back by fear; but after seeing you, on this occasion, so chatty, so full of fun and most considerate to others, how can I not come? were it to be the cause of my death, I would be even willing to come!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're really a clever person,&quot; lady Feng observed sarcastically. &quot;And oh so much superior to both Chia Jung and his brother! Handsome as their presence was to look at, I imagined their minds to be full of intelligence, but who would have thought that they would, after all, be a couple of stupid worms, without the least notion of human affection!&quot;</p>
<p>The words which Chia Jui heard, fell in so much the more with his own sentiments, that he could not restrain himself from again pressing forward nearer to her; and as with eyes strained to give intentness to his view, he gazed at lady Feng's purse: &quot;What rings have you got on?&quot; he went on to ask.</p>
<p>&quot;You should be a little more deferential,&quot; remonstrated lady Feng in a low tone of voice, &quot;so as not to let the waiting-maids detect us.&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Jui withdrew backward with as much alacrity as if he had received an Imperial decree or a mandate from Buddha.</p>
<p>&quot;You ought to be going!&quot; lady Feng suggested, as she gave him a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Do let me stay a while longer,&quot; entreated Chia Jui, &quot;you are indeed ruthless, my sister-in-law.&quot;</p>
<p>But with gentle voice did lady Feng again expostulate. &quot;In broad daylight,&quot; she said, &quot;with people coming and going, it is not really convenient that you should abide in here; so you had better go, and when it's dark and the watch is set, you can come over, and quietly wait for me in the corridor on the Eastern side!&quot;</p>
<p>At these words, Chia Jui felt as if he had received some jewel or precious thing. &quot;Don't make fun of me!&quot; he remarked with vehemence. &quot;The only thing is that crowds of people are ever passing from there, and how will it be possible for me to evade detection?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Set your mind at ease!&quot; lady Feng advised; &quot;I shall dismiss on leave all the youths on duty at night; and when the doors, on both sides, are closed, there will be no one else to come in!&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Jui was delighted beyond measure by the assurance, and with impetuous haste, he took his leave and went off; convinced at heart of the gratification of his wishes. He continued, up to the time of dusk, a prey to keen expectation; and, when indeed darkness fell, he felt his way into the Jung mansion, availing himself of the moment, when the doors were being closed, to slip into the corridor, where everything was actually pitch dark, and not a soul to be seen going backwards or forwards.</p>
<p>The door leading over to dowager lady Chia's apartments had already been put under key, and there was but one gate, the one on the East, which had not as yet been locked. Chia Jui lent his ear, and listened for ever so long, but he saw no one appear. Suddenly, however, was heard a sound like &quot;lo teng,&quot; and the east gate was also bolted; but though Chia Jui was in a great state of impatience, he none the less did not venture to utter a sound. All that necessity compelled him to do was to issue, with quiet steps, from his corner, and to try the gates by pushing; but they were closed as firmly as if they had been made fast with iron bolts; and much though he may, at this juncture, have wished to find his way out, escape was, in fact, out of the question; on the south and north was one continuous dead wall, which, even had he wished to scale, there was nothing which he could clutch and pull himself up by.</p>
<p>This room, besides, was one the interior (of which was exposed) to the wind, which entered through (the fissure) of the door; and was perfectly empty and bare; and the weather being, at this time, that of December, and the night too very long, the northerly wind, with its biting gusts, was sufficient to penetrate the flesh and to cleave the bones, so that the whole night long he had a narrow escape from being frozen to death; and he was yearning, with intolerable anxiety for the break of day, when he espied an old matron go first and open the door on the East side, and then come in and knock at the western gate.</p>
<p>Chia Jui seeing that she had turned her face away, bolted out, like a streak of smoke, as he hugged his shoulders with his hands (from intense cold.) As luck would have it, the hour was as yet early, so that the inmates of the house had not all got out of bed; and making his escape from the postern door, he straightaway betook himself home, running back the whole way.</p>
<p>Chia Jui's parents had, it must be explained, departed life at an early period, and he had no one else, besides his grandfather Tai-ju, to take charge of his support and education. This Tai-ju had, all along, exercised a very strict control, and would not allow Chia Jui to even make one step too many, in the apprehension that he might gad about out of doors drinking and gambling, to the neglect of his studies.</p>
<p>Seeing, on this unexpected occasion, that he had not come home the whole night, he simply felt positive, in his own mind, that he was certain to have run about, if not drinking, at least gambling, and dissipating in houses of the demi-monde up to the small hours; but he never even gave so much as a thought to the possibility of a public scandal, as that in which he was involved. The consequence was that during the whole length of the night he boiled with wrath.</p>
<p>Chia Jui himself, on the other hand, was (in such a state of trepidation) that he could wipe the perspiration (off his face) by handfuls; and he felt constrained on his return home, to have recourse to deceitful excuses, simply explaining that he had been at his eldest maternal uncle's house, and that when it got dark, they kept him to spend the night there.</p>
<p>&quot;Hitherto,&quot; remonstrated Tai-ju, &quot;when about to go out of doors, you never ventured to go, on your own hook, without first telling me about it, and how is it that yesterday you surreptitiously left the house? for this offence alone you deserve a beating, and how much more for the lie imposed upon me.&quot;</p>
<p>Into such a violent fit of anger did he consequently fly that laying hands on him, he pulled him over and administered to him thirty or forty blows with a cane. Nor would he allow him to have anything to eat, but bade him remain on his knees in the court conning essays; impressing on his mind that he would not let him off, before he had made up for the last ten days' lessons.</p>
<p>Chia Jui had in the first instance, frozen the whole night, and, in the next place, came in for a flogging. With a stomach, besides, gnawed by the pangs of hunger, he had to kneel in a place exposed to drafts reading the while literary compositions, so that the hardships he had to endure were of manifold kinds.</p>
<p>Chia Jui's infamous intentions had at this junction undergone no change; but far from his thoughts being even then any idea that lady Feng was humbugging him, he seized, after the lapse of a couple of days, the first leisure moments to come again in search of that lady.</p>
<p>Lady Feng pretended to bear him a grudge for his breach of faith, and Chia Jui was so distressed that he tried by vows and oaths (to establish his innocence.) Lady Feng perceiving that he had, of his own accord, fallen into the meshes of the net laid for him, could not but devise another plot to give him a lesson and make him know what was right and mend his ways.</p>
<p>With this purpose, she gave him another assignation. &quot;Don't go over there,&quot; she said, &quot;to-night, but wait for me in the empty rooms giving on to a small passage at the back of these apartments of mine. But whatever you do, mind don't be reckless.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you in real earnest?&quot; Chia Jui inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, who wants to play with you?&quot; replied lady Feng; &quot;if you don't believe what I say, well then don't come!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll come, I'll come, yea I'll come, were I even to die!&quot; protested<br>
Chia Jui.\</p>
<p>&quot;You should first at this very moment get away!&quot; lady Feng having suggested, Chia Jui, who felt sanguine that when evening came, success would for a certainty crown his visit, took at once his departure in anticipation (of his pleasure.)</p>
<p>During this interval lady Feng hastily set to work to dispose of her resources, and to add to her stratagems, and she laid a trap for her victim; while Chia Jui, on the other hand, was until the shades of darkness fell, a prey to incessant expectation.</p>
<p>As luck would have it a relative of his happened to likewise come on that very night to their house and to only leave after he had dinner with them, and at an hour of the day when the lamps had already been lit; but he had still to wait until his grandfather had retired to rest before he could, at length with precipitate step, betake himself into the Jung mansion.</p>
<p>Straightway he came into the rooms in the narrow passage, and waited with as much trepidation as if he had been an ant in a hot pan. He however waited and waited, but he saw no one arrive; he listened but not even the sound of a voice reached his ear. His heart was full of intense fear, and he could not restrain giving way to surmises and suspicion. &quot;May it not be,&quot; he thought, &quot;that she is not coming again; and that I may have once more to freeze for another whole night?&quot;</p>
<p>While indulging in these erratic reflections, he discerned some one coming, looking like a black apparition, who Chia Jui readily concluded, in his mind, must be lady Feng; so that, unmindful of distinguishing black from white, he as soon as that person arrived in front of him, speedily clasped her in his embrace, like a ravenous tiger pouncing upon its prey, or a cat clawing a rat, and cried: &quot;My darling sister, you have made me wait till I'm ready to die.&quot;</p>
<p>As he uttered these words, he dragged the comer, in his arms, on to the couch in the room; and while indulging in kisses and protestations of warm love, he began to cry out at random epithets of endearment.</p>
<p>Not a sound, however, came from the lips of the other person; and Chia Jui had in the fulness of his passion, exceeded the bounds of timid love and was in the act of becoming still more affectionate in his protestations, when a sudden flash of a light struck his eye, by the rays of which he espied Chia Se with a candle in hand, casting the light round the place, &quot;Who's in this room?&quot; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Uncle Jui,&quot; he heard some one on the couch explain, laughing, &quot;was trying to take liberties with me!&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Jui at one glance became aware that it was no other than Chia Jung; and a sense of shame at once so overpowered him that he could find nowhere to hide himself; nor did he know how best to extricate himself from the dilemma. Turning himself round, he made an attempt to make good his escape, when Chia Se with one grip clutched him in his hold.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't run away,&quot; he said; &quot;sister-in-law Lien has already reported your conduct to madame Wang; and explained that you had tried to make her carry on an improper flirtation with you; that she had temporised by having recourse to a scheme to escape your importunities, and that she had imposed upon you in such a way as to make you wait for her in this place. Our lady was so terribly incensed, that she well-nigh succumbed; and hence it is that she bade me come and catch you! Be quick now and follow me, and let us go and see her.&quot;</p>
<p>After Chia Jui had heard these words, his very soul could not be contained within his body.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear nephew,&quot; he entreated, &quot;do tell her that it wasn't I; and I'll show you my gratitude to-morrow in a substantial manner.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Letting you off,&quot; rejoined Chia Se, &quot;is no difficult thing; but how much, I wonder, are you likely to give? Besides, what you now utter with your lips, there will be no proof to establish; so you had better write a promissory note.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How could I put what happened in black and white on paper?&quot; observed<br>
Chia Jui.\</p>
<p>&quot;There's no difficulty about that either!&quot; replied Chia Se; &quot;just write an account of a debt due, for losses in gambling, to some one outside; for payment of which you had to raise funds, by a loan of a stated number of taels, from the head of the house; and that will be all that is required.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is, in fact, easy enough!&quot; Chia Jui having added by way of answer; Chia Se turned round and left the room; and returning with paper and pencils, which had been got ready beforehand for the purpose, he bade Chia Jui write. The two of them (Chia Jung and Chia Se) tried, the one to do a good turn, and the other to be perverse in his insistence; but (Chia Jui) put down no more than fifty taels, and appended his signature.</p>
<p>Chia Se pocketed the note, and endeavoured subsequently to induce Chia Jung to come away; but Chia Jung was, at the outset, obdurate and unwilling to give in, and kept on repeating; &quot;To-morrow, I'll tell the members of our clan to look into your nice conduct!&quot;</p>
<p>These words plunged Chia Jui in such a state of dismay, that he even went so far as to knock his head on the ground; but, as Chia Se was trying to get unfair advantage of him though he had at first done him a good turn, he had to write another promissory note for fifty taels, before the matter was dropped.</p>
<p>Taking up again the thread of the conversation, Chia Se remarked, &quot;Now when I let you go, I'm quite ready to bear the blame! But the gate at our old lady's over there is already bolted, and Mr. Chia Cheng is just now engaged in the Hall, looking at the things which have arrived from Nanking, so that it would certainly be difficult for you to pass through that way. The only safe course at present is by the back gate; but if you do go by there, and perchance meet any one, even I will be in for a mess; so you might as well wait until I go first and have a peep, when I'll come and fetch you! You couldn't anyhow conceal yourself in this room; for in a short time they'll be coming to stow the things away, and you had better let me find a safe place for you.&quot;</p>
<p>These words ended, he took hold of Chia Jui, and, extinguishing again the lantern, he brought him out into the court, feeling his way up to the bottom of the steps of the large terrace. &quot;It's safe enough in this nest,&quot; he observed, &quot;but just squat down quietly and don't utter a sound; wait until I come back before you venture out.&quot;</p>
<p>Having concluded this remark, the two of them (Chia Se and Chia Jung) walked away; while Chia Jui was, all this time, out of his senses, and felt constrained to remain squatting at the bottom of the terrace stairs. He was about to consider what course was open for him to adopt, when he heard a noise just over his head; and, with a splash, the contents of a bucket, consisting entirely of filthy water, was emptied straight down over him from above, drenching, as luck would have it, his whole person and head.</p>
<p>Chia Jui could not suppress an exclamation. &quot;Ai ya!&quot; he cried, but he hastily stopped his mouth with his hands, and did not venture to give vent to another sound. His whole head and face were a mass of filth, and his body felt icy cold. But as he shivered and shook, he espied Chia Se come running. &quot;Get off,&quot; he shouted, &quot;with all speed! off with you at once!&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as Chia Jui returned to life again, he bolted with hasty strides, out of the back gate, and ran the whole way home. The night had already reached the third watch, so that he had to knock at the door for it to be opened.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot; inquired the servants, when they saw him in this sorry plight; (an inquiry) which placed him in the necessity of making some false excuse. &quot;The night was dark,&quot; he explained, &quot;and my foot slipped and I fell into a gutter.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, he betook himself speedily to his own apartment; and it was only after he had changed his clothes and performed his ablutions, that he began to realise that lady Feng had made a fool of him. He consequently gave way to a fit of wrath; but upon recalling to mind the charms of lady Feng's face, he felt again extremely aggrieved that he could not there and then clasp her in his embrace, and as he indulged in these wild thoughts and fanciful ideas, he could not the whole night long close his eyes.</p>
<p>From this time forward his mind was, it is true, still with lady Feng, but he did not have the courage to put his foot into the Jung mansion; and with Chia Jung and Chia Se both coming time and again to dun him for the money, he was likewise full of fears lest his grandfather should come to know everything.</p>
<p>His passion for lady Feng was, in fact, already a burden hard to bear, and when, moreover, the troubles of debts were superadded to his tasks, which were also during the whole day arduous, he, a young man of about twenty, as yet unmarried, and a prey to constant cravings for lady Feng, which were difficult to gratify, could not avoid giving way, to a great extent, to such evil habits as exhausted his energies. His lot had, what is more, been on two occasions to be frozen, angered and to endure much hardship, so that with the attacks received time and again from all sides, he unconsciously soon contracted an organic disease. In his heart inflammation set in; his mouth lost the sense of taste; his feet got as soft as cotton from weakness; his eyes stung, as if there were vinegar in them. At night, he burnt with fever. During the day, he was repeatedly under the effects of lassitude. Perspiration was profuse, while with his expectorations of phlegm, he brought up blood. The whole number of these several ailments came upon him, before the expiry of a year, (with the result that) in course of time, he had not the strength to bear himself up. Of a sudden, he would fall down, and with his eyes, albeit closed, his spirit would be still plunged in confused dreams, while his mouth would be full of nonsense and he would be subject to strange starts.</p>
<p>Every kind of doctor was asked to come in, and every treatment had recourse to; and, though of such medicines as cinnamon, aconitum seeds, turtle shell, ophiopogon, Yü-chü herb, and the like, he took several tens of catties, he nevertheless experienced no change for the better; so that by the time the twelfth moon drew once again to an end, and spring returned, this illness had become still more serious.</p>
<p>Tai-ju was very much concerned, and invited doctors from all parts to attend to him, but none of them could do him any good. And as later on, he had to take nothing else but decoctions of pure ginseng, Tai-ju could not of course afford it. Having no other help but to come over to the Jung mansion, and make requisition for some, Madame Wang asked lady Feng to weigh two taels of it and give it to him. &quot;The other day,&quot; rejoined lady Feng, &quot;not long ago, when we concocted some medicine for our dowager lady, you told us, madame, to keep the pieces that were whole, to present to the spouse of General Yang to make physic with, and as it happens it was only yesterday that I sent some one round with them.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If there's none over here in our place,&quot; suggested madame Wang, &quot;just send a servant to your mother-in-law's, on the other side, to inquire whether they have any. Or it may possibly be that your elder brother-in-law Chen, over there, might have a little. If so, put all you get together, and give it to them; and when he shall have taken it, and got well and you shall have saved the life of a human being, it will really be to the benefit of you all.&quot;</p>
<p>Lady Feng acquiesced; but without directing a single person to institute any search, she simply took some refuse twigs, and making up a few mace, she despatched them with the meagre message that they had been sent by madame Wang, and that there was, in fact, no more; subsequently reporting to madame Wang that she had asked for and obtained all there was and that she had collected as much as two taels, and forwarded it to them.</p>
<p>Chia Jui was, meanwhile, very anxious to recover his health, so that there was no medicine that he would not take, but the outlay of money was of no avail, for he derived no benefit.</p>
<p>On a certain day and at an unexpected moment, a lame Taoist priest came to beg for alms, and he averred that he had the special gift of healing diseases arising from grievances received, and as Chia Jui happened, from inside, to hear what he said, he forthwith shouted out: &quot;Go at once, and bid that divine come in and save my life!&quot; while he reverentially knocked his head on the pillow.</p>
<p>The whole bevy of servants felt constrained to usher the Taoist in; and Chia Jui, taking hold of him with a dash, &quot;My Buddha!&quot; he repeatedly cried out, &quot;save my life!&quot;</p>
<p>The Taoist heaved a sigh. &quot;This ailment of yours,&quot; he remarked, &quot;is not one that could be healed with any medicine; I have a precious thing here which I'll give you, and if you gaze at it every day, your life can be saved!&quot;</p>
<p>When he had done talking, he produced from his pouch a looking-glass which could reflect a person's face on the front and back as well. On the upper part of the back were engraved the four characters: &quot;Precious Mirror of Voluptuousness.&quot; Handing it over to Chia Jui: &quot;This object,&quot; he proceeded, &quot;emanates from the primordial confines of the Great Void and has been wrought by the Monitory Dream Fairy in the Palace of Unreality and Spirituality, with the sole intent of healing the illnesses which originate from evil thoughts and improper designs. Possessing, as it does, the virtue of relieving mankind and preserving life, I have consequently brought it along with me into the world, but I only give it to those intelligent preëminent and refined princely men to set their eyes on. On no account must you look at the front side; and you should only gaze at the back of it; this is urgent, this is expedient! After three days, I shall come and fetch it away; by which time, I'm sure, it will have made him all right.&quot;</p>
<p>These words finished, he walked away with leisurely step, and though all tried to detain him, they could not succeed.</p>
<p>Chia Jui received the mirror. &quot;This Taoist,&quot; he thought, &quot;would seem to speak sensibly, and why should I not look at it and try its effect?&quot; At the conclusion of these thoughts, he took up the Mirror of Voluptuousness, and cast his eyes on the obverse side; but upon perceiving nought else than a skeleton standing in it, Chia Jui sustained such a fright that he lost no time in covering it with his hands and in abusing the Taoist. &quot;You good-for-nothing!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;why should you frighten me so? but I'll go further and look at the front and see what it's like.&quot;</p>
<p>While he reflected in this manner, he readily looked into the face of the mirror, wherein he caught sight of lady Feng standing, nodding her head and beckoning to him. With one gush of joy, Chia Jui felt himself, in a vague and mysterious manner, transported into the mirror, where he held an affectionate tête-à-tête with lady Feng. Lady Feng escorted him out again. On his return to bed, he gave vent to an exclamation of &quot;Ai yah!&quot; and opening his eyes, he turned the glass over once more; but still, as hitherto, stood the skeleton in the back part.</p>
<p>Chia Jui had, it is true, experienced all the pleasant sensations of a tête-à-tête, but his heart nevertheless did not feel gratified; so that he again turned the front round, and gazed at lady Feng, as she still waved her hand and beckoned to him to go. Once more entering the mirror, he went on in the same way for three or four times, until this occasion, when just as he was about to issue from the mirror, he espied two persons come up to him, who made him fast with chains round the neck, and hauled him away. Chia Jui shouted. &quot;Let me take the mirror and I'll come along.&quot; But only this remark could he utter, for it was forthwith beyond his power to say one word more. The servants, who stood by in attendance, saw him at first still holding the glass in his hand and looking in, and then, when it fell from his grasp, open his eyes again to pick it up, but when at length the mirror dropped, and he at once ceased to move, they in a body came forward to ascertain what had happened to him. He had already breathed his last. The lower part of his body was icy-cold; his clothes moist from profuse perspiration. With all promptitude they changed him there and then, and carried him to another bed.</p>
