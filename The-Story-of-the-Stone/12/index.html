    <h1>11</h1>
    <p>Hua Tzu-fang, upon hearing that there was good reason in what he said, promptly clasped Pao-yü out of the chair and put him on the horse, whereupon after Pao-yü smilingly remarked: &quot;Excuse me for the trouble I've surely put you to,&quot; they forthwith entered again by the back gate; but putting aside all details, we will now confine ourselves to Pao-yü.</p>
<p>After he had walked out of the door, the several waiting-maids in his apartments played and laughed with greater zest and with less restraint. Some there were who played at chess, others who threw the dice or had a game of cards; and they covered the whole floor with the shells of melon-seeds they were cracking, when dame Li, his nurse, happened to come in, propping herself on a staff, to pay her respects and to see Pao-yü, and perceiving that Pao-yü was not at home and that the servant-girls were only bent upon romping, she felt intensely disgusted. &quot;Since I've left this place,&quot; she therefore exclaimed with a sigh, &quot;and don't often come here, you've become more and more unmannerly; while the other nurse does still less than ever venture to expostulate with you; Pao-yü is like a candlestick eighty feet high, shedding light on others, and throwing none upon himself! All he knows is to look down upon people as being filthy; and yet this is his room and he allows you to put it topsy-turvey, and to become more and more unmindful of decorum!&quot;</p>
<p>These servant-girls were well aware that Pao-yü was not particular in these respects, and that in the next place nurse Li, having pleaded old age, resigned her place and gone home, had nowadays no control over them, so that they simply gave their minds to romping and joking, and paid no heed whatever to her. Nurse Li however still kept on asking about Pao-yü, &quot;How much rice he now ate at one meal? and at what time he went to sleep?&quot; to which questions, the servant-girls replied quite at random; some there being too who observed: &quot;What a dreadful despicable old thing she is!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In this covered bowl,&quot; she continued to inquire, &quot;is cream, and why not give it to me to eat?&quot; and having concluded these words, she took it up and there and then began eating it.</p>
<p>&quot;Be quick, and leave it alone!&quot; a servant-girl expostulated, &quot;that, he said, was kept in order to be given to Hsi Jen; and on his return, when he again gets into a huff, you, old lady, must, on your own motion, confess to having eaten it, and not involve us in any way as to have to bear his resentment.&quot;</p>
<p>Nurse Li, at these words, felt both angry and ashamed. &quot;I can't believe,&quot; she forthwith remarked, &quot;that he has become so bad at heart! Not to speak of the milk I've had, I have, in fact every right to even something more expensive than this; for is it likely that he holds Hsi Jen dearer than myself? It can't forsooth be that he doesn't bear in mind how that I've brought him up to be a big man, and how that he has eaten my blood transformed into milk and grown up to this age! and will be because I'm now having a bowl of milk of his be angry on that score! I shall, yes, eat it, and we'll see what he'll do! I don't know what you people think of Hsi Jen, but she was a lowbred girl, whom I've with my own hands raised up! and what fine object indeed was she!&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, she flew into a temper, and taking the cream she drank the whole of it.</p>
<p>&quot;They don't know how to speak properly!&quot; another servant-girl interposed sarcastically, &quot;and it's no wonder that you, old lady, should get angry! Pao-yü still sends you, venerable dame, presents as a proof of his gratitude, and is it possible that he will feel displeased for such a thing like this?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You girls shouldn't also pretend to be artful flatterers to cajole me!&quot; nurse Li added; &quot;do you imagine that I'm not aware of the dismissal, the other day, of Hsi Hsüeh, on account of a cup of tea? and as it's clear enough that I've incurred blame, I'll come by and by and receive it!&quot;</p>
<p>Having said this, she went off in a dudgeon, but not a long interval elapsed before Pao-yü returned, and gave orders to go and fetch Hsi Jen; and perceiving Ching Ling reclining on the bed perfectly still: &quot;I presume she's ill,&quot; Pao-yü felt constrained to inquire, &quot;or if she isn't ill, she must have lost at cards.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not so!&quot; observed Chiu Wen; &quot;she had been a winner, but dame Li came in quite casually and muddled her so that she lost; and angry at this she rushed off to sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't place yourselves,&quot; Pao-yü smiled, &quot;on the same footing as nurse<br>
Li, and if you were to let her alone, everything will be all right.&quot;\</p>
<p>These words were still on his lips when Hsi Jen arrived. After the mutual salutations, Hsi Jen went on to ask of Pao-yü: &quot;Where did you have your repast? and what time did you come back?&quot; and to present likewise, on behalf of her mother and sister, her compliments to all the girls, who were her companions. In a short while, she changed her costume and divested herself of her fineries, and Pao-yü bade them fetch the cream.</p>
<p>&quot;Nurse Li has eaten it,&quot; the servant-girls rejoined, and as Pao-yü was on the point of making some remark Hsi Jen hastened to interfere, laughing the while; &quot;Is it really this that you had kept for me? many thanks for the trouble; the other day, when I had some, I found it very toothsome, but after I had partaken of it, I got a pain in the stomach, and was so much upset, that it was only after I had brought it all up that I felt all right. So it's as well that she has had it, for, had it been kept here, it would have been wasted all for no use! What I fancy are dry chestnuts; and while you clean a few for me, I'll go and lay the bed!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü upon hearing these words credited them as true, so that he discarded all thought of the cream and fetched the chestnuts, which he, with his own hands, selected and pealed. Perceiving at the same time that none of the party were present in the room, he put on a smile and inquired of Hsi Jen: &quot;Who were those persons dressed in red to day?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They're my two cousins on my mother's side,&quot; Hsi Jen explained, and hearing this, Pao-yü sang their praise as he heaved a couple of sighs.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you sighing for?&quot; Hsi Jen remarked. &quot;I know the secret reasons of your heart; it's I fancy because she isn't fit to wear red!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It isn't that,&quot; Pao-yü protested smilingly, &quot;it isn't that; if such a person as that isn't good enough to be dressed in red, who would forsooth presume to wear it? It's because I find her so really lovely! and if we could, after all, manage to get her into our family, how nice it would be then!&quot;</p>
<p>Hsi Jen gave a sardonic smile. &quot;That it's my own fate to be a slave doesn't matter, but is it likely that the destiny of even my very relatives could be to become one and all of them bond servants? But you should certainly set your choice upon some really beautiful girl, for she would in that case be good enough to enter your house.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Here you are again with your touchiness!&quot; Pao-yü eagerly exclaimed smiling, &quot;if I said that she should come to our house, does it necessarily imply that she should be a servant? and wouldn't it do were I to mention that she should come as a relative!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That too couldn't exalt her to be a fit match for you!&quot; rejoined Hsi Jen; but Pao-yü being loth to continue the conversation, simply busied himself with cleaning the chestnuts.</p>
<p>&quot;How is it you utter not a word?&quot; Hsi Jen laughed; &quot;I expect it's because I just offended you by my inconsiderate talk! But if by and by you have your purpose fixed on it, just spend a few ounces of silver to purchase them with, and bring them in and have done!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How would you have one make any reply?&quot; Pao-yü smilingly rejoined; &quot;all I did was to extol her charms; for she's really fit to have been born in a deep hall and spacious court as this; and it isn't for such foul things as myself and others to contrariwise spend our days in this place!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Though deprived of this good fortune,&quot; Hsi Jen explained, &quot;she's nevertheless also petted and indulged and the jewel of my maternal uncle and my aunt! She's now seventeen years of age, and everything in the way of trousseau has been got ready, and she's to get married next year.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon hearing the two words &quot;get married,&quot; he could not repress himself from again ejaculating: &quot;Hai hai!&quot; but while he was in an unhappy frame of mind, he once more heard Hsi Jen remark as she heaved a sigh: &quot;Ever since I've come here, we cousins haven't all these years been able to get to live together, and now that I'm about to return home, they, on the other hand, will all be gone!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü, realising that there lurked in this remark some meaning or other, was suddenly so taken aback that dropping the chestnuts, he inquired: &quot;How is it that you now want to go back?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was present to-day,&quot; Hsi Jen explained, &quot;when mother and brother held consultation together, and they bade me be patient for another year, and that next year they'll come up and redeem me out of service!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü, at these words, felt the more distressed. &quot;Why do they want to redeem you?&quot; he consequently asked.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a strange question!&quot; Hsi Jen retorted, &quot;for I can't really be treated as if I were the issue born in this homestead of yours! All the members of my family are elsewhere, and there's only myself in this place, so that how could I end my days here?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I don't let you go, it will verily be difficult for you to get away!&quot; Pao-yü replied.</p>
<p>&quot;There has never been such a principle of action!&quot; urged Hsi Jen; &quot;even in the imperial palace itself, there's a fixed rule, by which possibly every certain number of years a selection (of those who have to go takes place), and every certain number of years a new batch enters; and there's no such practice as that of keeping people for ever; not to speak of your own home.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü realised, after reflection, that she, in point of fact, was right, and he went on to observe: &quot;Should the old lady not give you your release, it will be impossible for you to get off.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why shouldn't she release me?&quot; Hsi Jen questioned. &quot;Am I really so very extraordinary a person as to have perchance made such an impression upon her venerable ladyship and my lady that they will be positive in not letting me go? They may, in all likelihood, give my family some more ounces of silver to keep me here; that possibly may come about. But, in truth, I'm also a person of the most ordinary run, and there are many more superior to me, yea very many! Ever since my youth up, I've been in her old ladyship's service; first by waiting upon Miss Shih for several years, and recently by being in attendance upon you for another term of years; and now that our people will come to redeem me, I should, as a matter of right, be told to go. My idea is that even the very redemption money won't be accepted, and that they will display such grace as to let me go at once. And, as for being told that I can't be allowed to go as I'm so diligent in my service to you, that's a thing that can on no account come about! My faithful attendance is an obligation of my duties, and is no exceptional service! and when I'm gone you'll again have some other faithful attendant, and it isn't likely that when I'm no more here, you'll find it impracticable to obtain one!&quot;</p>
<p>After Pao-yü had listened to these various arguments, which proved the reasonableness of her going and the unreasonableness of any detention, he felt his heart more than ever a prey to distress. &quot;In spite of all you say,&quot; he therefore continued, &quot;the sole desire of my heart is to detain you; and I have no doubt but that the old lady will speak to your mother about it; and if she were to give your mother ample money, she'll, of course, not feel as if she could very well with any decency take you home!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mother won't naturally have the audacity to be headstrong!&quot; Hsi Jen ventured, &quot;not to speak besides of the nice things, which may be told her and the lots of money she may, in addition, be given; but were she even not to be paid any compliments, and not so much as a single cash given her, she won't, if you set your mind upon keeping me here, presume not to comply with your wishes, were it also against my inclination. One thing however; our family would never rely upon prestige, and trust upon honorability to do anything so domineering as this! for this isn't like anything else, which, because you take a fancy to it, a hundred per cent profit can be added, and it obtained for you! This action can be well taken if the seller doesn't suffer loss! But in the present instance, were they to keep me back for no rhyme or reason, it would also be of no benefit to yourself; on the contrary, they would be instrumental in keeping us blood relatives far apart; a thing the like of which, I feel positive that dowager lady Chia and my lady will never do!&quot;</p>
<p>After lending an ear to this argument, Pao-yü cogitated within himself for a while. &quot;From what you say,&quot; he then observed, &quot;when you say you'll go, it means that you'll go for certain!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that I'll go for certain,&quot; Hsi Jen rejoined.</p>
<p>&quot;Who would have anticipated,&quot; Pao-yü, after these words, mused in his own heart, &quot;that a person like her would have shown such little sense of gratitude, and such a lack of respect! Had I,&quot; he then remarked aloud with a sigh, &quot;been aware, at an early date, that your whole wish would have been to go, I wouldn't, in that case, have brought you over! But when you're away, I shall remain alone, a solitary spirit!&quot;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he lost control over his temper, and, getting into bed, he went to sleep.</p>
<p>The fact is that when Hsi Jen had been at home, and she heard her mother and brother express their intention of redeeming her back, she there and then observed that were she even at the point of death, she would not return home. &quot;When in past days,&quot; she had argued, &quot;you had no rice to eat, there remained myself, who was still worth several taels; and hadn't I urged you to sell me, wouldn't I have seen both father and mother die of starvation under my very eyes? and you've now had the good fortune of selling me into this place, where I'm fed and clothed just like a mistress, and where I'm not beaten by day, nor abused by night! Besides, though now father be no more, you two have anyhow by putting things straight again, so adjusted the family estate that it has resumed its primitive condition. And were you, in fact, still in straitened circumstances, and you could by redeeming me back, make again some more money, that would be well and good; but the truth is that there's no such need, and what would be the use for you to redeem me at such a time as this? You should temporarily treat me as dead and gone, and shouldn't again recall any idea of redeeming me!&quot;</p>
<p>Having in consequence indulged in a loud fit of crying, her mother and brother resolved, when they perceived her in this determined frame of mind, that for a fact there was no need for her to come out of service. What is more they had sold her under contract until death, in the distinct reliance that the Chia family, charitable and generous a family as it was, would, possibly, after no more than a few entreaties, make them a present of her person as well as the purchase money. In the second place, never had they in the Chia mansion ill-used any of those below; there being always plenty of grace and little of imperiousness. Besides, the servant-girls, who acted as personal attendants in the apartments of the old as well as of the young, were treated so far unlike the whole body of domestics in the household that the daughters even of an ordinary and penniless parentage could not have been so looked up to. And these considerations induced both the mother as well as her son to at once dispel the intention and not to redeem her, and when Pao-yü had subsequently paid them an unexpected visit, and the two of them (Pao-yü and Hsi Jen) were seen to be also on such terms, the mother and her son obtained a clearer insight into their relations, and still one more burden (which had pressed on their mind) fell to the ground, and as besides this was a contingency, which they had never reckoned upon, they both composed their hearts, and did not again entertain any idea of ransoming her.</p>
<p>It must be noticed moreover that Hsi Jen had ever since her youth not been blind to the fact that Pao-yü had an extraordinary temperament, that he was self-willed and perverse, far even in excess of all young lads, and that he had, in addition, a good many peculiarities and many unspeakable defects. And as of late he had placed such reliance in the fond love of his grandmother that his father and mother even could not exercise any extreme control over him, he had become so much the more remiss, dissolute, selfish and unconcerned, not taking the least pleasure in what was proper, that she felt convinced, whenever she entertained the idea of tendering him advice, that he would not listen to her. On this day, by a strange coincidence, came about the discussion respecting her ransom, and she designedly made use, in the first instance, of deception with a view to ascertain his feelings, to suppress his temper, and to be able subsequently to extend to him some words of admonition; and when she perceived that Pao-yü had now silently gone to sleep, she knew that his feelings could not brook the idea of her return and that his temper had already subsided. She had never had, as far as she was concerned, any desire of eating chestnuts, but as she feared lest, on account of the cream, some trouble might arise, which might again lead to the same results as when Hsi Hsüeh drank the tea, she consequently made use of the pretence that she fancied chestnuts, in order to put off Pao-yü from alluding (to the cream) and to bring the matter speedily to an end. But telling forthwith the young waiting-maids to take the chestnuts away and eat them, she herself came and pushed Pao-yü; but at the sight of Pao-yü with the traces of tears on his face, she at once put on a smiling expression and said: &quot;What's there in this to wound your heart? If you positively do wish to keep me, I shall, of course, not go away!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü noticed that these words contained some hidden purpose, and readily observed: &quot;Do go on and tell me what else I can do to succeed in keeping you here, for of my own self I find it indeed difficult to say how!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Of our friendliness all along,&quot; Hsi Jen smilingly rejoined, &quot;there's naturally no need to speak; but, if you have this day made up your mind to retain me here, it isn't through this friendship that you'll succeed in doing so. But I'll go on and mention three distinct conditions, and, if you really do accede to my wishes, you'll then have shown an earnest desire to keep me here, and I won't go, were even a sword to be laid on my neck!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do tell me what these conditions are,&quot; Pao-yü pressed her with alacrity, as he smiled, &quot;and I'll assent to one and all. My dear sister, my own dear sister, not to speak of two or three, but even two or three hundred of them I'm quite ready to accept. All I entreat you is that you and all of you should combine to watch over me and take care of me, until some day when I shall be transformed into flying ashes; but flying ashes are, after all, not opportune, as they have form and substance and they likewise possess sense, but until I've been metamorphosed into a streak of subtle smoke. And when the wind shall have with one puff dispelled me, all of you then will be unable to attend to me, just as much as I myself won't be able to heed you. You will, when that time comes, let me go where I please, as I'll let you speed where you choose to go!&quot;</p>
<p>These words so harassed Hsi Jen that she hastened to put her hand over his mouth. &quot;Speak decently,&quot; she said; &quot;I was on account of this just about to admonish you, and now here you are uttering all this still more loathsome trash.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I won't utter these words again,&quot; Pao-yü eagerly added.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the first fault that you must change,&quot; Hsi Jen replied.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll amend,&quot; Pao-yü observed, &quot;and if I say anything of the kind again you can wring my mouth; but what else is there?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The second thing is this,&quot; Hsi Jen explained; &quot;whether you really like to study or whether you only pretend to like study is immaterial; but you should, when you are in the presence of master, or in the presence of any one else, not do nothing else than find fault with people and make fun of them, but behave just as if you were genuinely fond of study, so that you shouldn't besides provoke your father so much to anger, and that he should before others have also a chance of saying something! 'In my family,' he reflects within himself, 'generation after generation has been fond of books, but ever since I've had you, you haven't accomplished my expectations, and not only is it that you don't care about reading books,'&mdash;and this has already filled his heart with anger and vexation,&mdash;'but both before my face and behind my back, you utter all that stuff and nonsense, and give those persons, who have, through their knowledge of letters, attained high offices, the nickname of the &quot;the salaried worms.&quot; You also uphold that there's no work exclusive (of the book where appears) &quot;fathom spotless virtue;&quot; and that all other books consist of foolish compilations, which owe their origin to former authors, who, unable themselves to expound the writings of Confucius, readily struck a new line and invented original notions.' Now with words like these, how can one wonder if master loses all patience, and if he does from time to time give you a thrashing! and what do you make other people think of you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I won't say these things again,&quot; Pao-yü laughingly protested, &quot;these are the reckless and silly absurdities of a time when I was young and had no idea of the height of the heavens and the thickness of the earth; but I'll now no more repeat them. What else is there besides?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It isn't right that you should sneer at the bonzes and vilify the Taoist priests, nor mix cosmetics or prepare rouge,&quot; Hsi Jen continued; &quot;but there's still another thing more important, you shouldn't again indulge the bad habits of licking the cosmetic, applied by people on their lips, nor be fond of (girls dressed) in red!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll change in all this,&quot; Pao-yü added by way of rejoinder; &quot;I'll change in all this; and if there's anything more be quick and tell me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing more,&quot; Hsi Jen observed; &quot;but you must in everything exercise a little more diligence, and not indulge your caprices and allow your wishes to run riot, and you'll be all right. And should you comply to all these things in real earnest, you couldn't carry me out, even in a chair with eight bearers.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, if you do stay in here long enough,&quot; Pao-yü remarked with a smile, &quot;there's no fear as to your not having an eight-bearer-chair to sit in!&quot;</p>
<p>Hsi Jen gave a sardonic grin. &quot;I don't care much about it,&quot; she replied; &quot;and were I even to have such good fortune, I couldn't enjoy such a right. But allowing I could sit in one, there would be no pleasure in it!&quot;</p>
<p>While these two were chatting, they saw Ch'iu Wen walk in. &quot;It's the third watch of the night,&quot; she observed, &quot;and you should go to sleep. Just a few moments back your grandmother lady Chia and our lady sent a nurse to ask about you, and I replied that you were asleep.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü bade her fetch a watch, and upon looking at the time, he found indeed that the hand was pointing at ten; whereupon rinsing his mouth again and loosening his clothes, he retired to rest, where we will leave him without any further comment.</p>
<p>The next day, Hsi Jen got up as soon as it was dawn, feeling her body heavy, her head sore, her eyes swollen, and her limbs burning like fire. She managed however at first to keep up, an effort though it was, but as subsequently she was unable to endure the strain, and all she felt disposed to do was to recline, she therefore lay down in her clothes on the stove-couch. Pao-yü hastened to tell dowager lady Chia, and the doctor was sent for, who, upon feeling her pulse and diagnosing her complaint, declared that there was nothing else the matter with her than a chill, which she had suddenly contracted, that after she had taken a dose or two of medicine, it would be dispelled, and that she would be quite well. After he had written the prescription and taken his departure, some one was despatched to fetch the medicines, which when brought were properly decocted. As soon as she had swallowed a dose, Pao-yü bade her cover herself with her bed-clothes so as to bring on perspiration; while he himself came into Tai-yü's room to look her up. Tai-yü was at this time quite alone, reclining on her bed having a midday siesta, and the waiting-maids having all gone out to attend to whatever they pleased, the whole room was plunged in stillness and silence. Pao-yü raised the embroidered soft thread portiere and walked in; and upon espying Tai-yü in the room fast asleep, he hurriedly approached her and pushing her: &quot;Dear cousin,&quot; he said, &quot;you've just had your meal, and are you asleep already?&quot; and he kept on calling &quot;Tai-yü&quot; till he woke her out of her sleep.</p>
<p>Perceiving that it was Pao-yü, &quot;You had better go for a stroll,&quot; Tai-yü urged, &quot;for the day before yesterday I was disturbed the whole night, and up to this day I haven't had rest enough to get over the fatigue. My whole body feels languid and sore.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This languor and soreness,&quot; Pao-yü rejoined, &quot;are of no consequence; but if you go on sleeping you'll be feeling very ill; so I'll try and distract you, and when we've dispelled this lassitude, you'll be all right.&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü closed her eyes. &quot;I don't feel any lassitude,&quot; she explained, &quot;all I want is a little rest; and you had better go elsewhere and come back after romping about for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where can I go?&quot; Pao-yü asked as he pushed her. &quot;I'm quite sick and tired of seeing the others.&quot;</p>
<p>At these words, Tai-yü burst out laughing with a sound of Ch'ih. &quot;Well! since you wish to remain here,&quot; she added, &quot;go over there and sit down quietly, and let's have a chat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll also recline,&quot; Pao-yü suggested.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, then, recline!&quot; Tai-yü assented.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no pillow,&quot; observed Pao-yü, &quot;so let us lie on the same pillow.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What nonsense!&quot; Tai-yü urged, &quot;aren't those pillows outside? get one and lie on it.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü walked into the outer apartment, and having looked about him, he returned and remarked with a smile: &quot;I don't want those, they may be, for aught I know, some dirty old hag's.&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü at this remark opened her eyes wide, and as she raised herself up: &quot;You're really,&quot; she exclaimed laughingly, &quot;the evil star of my existence! here, please recline on this pillow!&quot; and as she uttered these words, she pushed her own pillow towards Pao-yü, and, getting up she went and fetched another of her own, upon which she lay her head in such a way that both of them then reclined opposite to each other. But Tai-yü, upon turning up her eyes and looking, espied on Pao-yü's cheek on the left side of his face, a spot of blood about the size of a button, and speedily bending her body, she drew near to him, and rubbing it with her hand, she scrutinised it closely. &quot;Whose nail,&quot; she went on to inquire, &quot;has scratched this open?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü with his body still reclining withdrew from her reach, and as he did so, he answered with a smile: &quot;It isn't a scratch; it must, I presume, be simply a drop, which bespattered my cheek when I was just now mixing and clarifying the cosmetic paste for them.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, he tried to get at his handkerchief to wipe it off; but Tai-yü used her own and rubbed it clean for him, while she observed: &quot;Do you still give your mind to such things? attend to them you may; but must you carry about you a placard (to make it public)? Though uncle mayn't see it, were others to notice it, they would treat it as a strange occurrence and a novel bit of news, and go and tell him to curry favour, and when it has reached uncle's ear, we shall all again not come out clean, and provoke him to anger.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü did not in the least heed what she said, being intent upon smelling a subtle scent which, in point of fact, emanated from Tai-yü's sleeve, and when inhaled inebriated the soul and paralysed the bones. With a snatch, Pao-yü laid hold of Tai-yü's sleeve meaning to see what object was concealed in it; but Tai-yü smilingly expostulated: &quot;At such a time as this,&quot; she said, &quot;who keeps scents about one?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, in that case,&quot; Pao-yü rejoined with a smirking face, &quot;where does this scent come from?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I myself don't know,&quot; Tai-yü replied; &quot;I presume it must be, there's no saying, some scent in the press which has impregnated the clothes.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't follow,&quot; Pao-yü added, as he shook his head; &quot;the fumes of this smell are very peculiar, and don't resemble the perfume of scent-bottles, scent-balls, or scented satchets!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it likely that I have, like others, Buddhistic disciples,&quot; Tai-yü asked laughing ironically, &quot;or worthies to give me novel kinds of scents? But supposing there is about me some peculiar scent, I haven't, at all events, any older or younger brothers to get the flowers, buds, dew, and snow, and concoct any for me; all I have are those common scents, that's all.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever I utter any single remark,&quot; Pao-yü urged with a grin, &quot;you at once bring up all these insinuations; but unless I deal with you severely, you'll never know what stuff I'm made of; but from henceforth I'll no more show you any grace!&quot;</p>
<p>As he spoke, he turned himself over, and raising himself, he puffed a couple of breaths into both his hands, and hastily stretching them out, he tickled Tai-yü promiscuously under her armpits, and along both sides. Tai-yü had never been able to stand tickling, so that when Pao-yü put out his two hands and tickled her violently, she forthwith giggled to such an extent that she could scarcely gasp for breath. &quot;If you still go on teasing me,&quot; she shouted, &quot;I'll get angry with you!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü then kept his hands off, and as he laughed, &quot;Tell me,&quot; he asked, &quot;will you again come out with all those words or not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I daren't do it again,&quot; Tai-yü smiled and adjusted her hair; adding with another laugh: &quot;I may have peculiar scents, but have you any 'warm' scents?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü at this question, could not for a time unfold its meaning: &quot;What 'warm' scent?&quot; he therefore asked.</p>
<p>Tai-yü nodded her head and smiled deridingly. &quot;How stupid! what a fool!&quot; she sighed; &quot;you have jade, and another person has gold to match with you, and if some one has 'cold' scent, haven't you any 'warm' scent as a set-off?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü at this stage alone understood the import of her remark.</p>
<p>&quot;A short while back you craved for mercy,&quot; Pao-yü observed smilingly, &quot;and here you are now going on talking worse than ever;&quot; and as he spoke he again put out his hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear cousin,&quot; Tai-yü speedily implored with a smirk, &quot;I won't venture to do it again.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As for letting you off,&quot; Pao-yü remarked laughing, &quot;I'll readily let you off, but do allow me to take your sleeve and smell it!&quot; and while uttering these words, he hastily pulled the sleeve, and pressing it against his face, kept on smelling it incessantly, whereupon Tai-yü drew her hand away and urged: &quot;You must be going now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Though you may wish me to go, I can't,&quot; Pao-yü smiled, &quot;so let us now lie down with all propriety and have a chat,&quot; laying himself down again, as he spoke, while Tai-yü likewise reclined, and covered her face with her handkerchief. Pao-yü in a rambling way gave vent to a lot of nonsense, which Tai-yü did not heed, and Pao-yü went on to inquire: &quot;How old she was when she came to the capital? what sights and antiquities she saw on the journey? what relics and curiosities there were at Yang Chou? what were the local customs and the habits of the people?&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü made no reply; and Pao-yü fearing lest she should go to sleep, and get ill, readily set to work to beguile her to keep awake. &quot;Ai yah!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;at Yang Chou, where your official residence is, has occurred a remarkable affair; have you heard about it?&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü perceiving that he spoke in earnest, that his words were correct and his face serious, imagined that what he referred to was a true story, and she therefore inquired what it was?</p>
<p>Pao-yü upon hearing her ask this question, forthwith suppressed a laugh, and, with a glib tongue, he began to spin a yarn. &quot;At Yang Chou,&quot; he said, &quot;there's a hill called the Tai hill; and on this hill stands a cave called the Lin Tzu.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This must all be lies,&quot; Tai-yü answered sneeringly, &quot;as I've never before heard of such a hill.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Under the heavens many are the hills and rivers,&quot; Pao-yü rejoined, &quot;and how could you know them all? Wait until I've done speaking, when you will be free to express your opinion!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go on then,&quot; Tai-yü suggested, whereupon Pao-yü prosecuted his raillery. &quot;In this Lin Tzu cave,&quot; he said, &quot;there was once upon a time a whole swarm of rat-elves. In some year or other and on the seventh day of the twelfth moon, an old rat ascended the throne to discuss matters. 'Tomorrow,' he argued, 'is the eighth of the twelfth moon, and men in the world will all be cooking the congee of the eighth of the twelfth moon. We have now in our cave a short supply of fruits of all kinds, and it would be well that we should seize this opportunity to steal a few and bring them over.' Drawing a mandatory arrow, he handed it to a small rat, full of aptitude, to go forward on a tour of inspection. The young rat on his return reported that he had already concluded his search and inquiries in every place and corner, and that in the temple at the bottom of the hill alone was the largest stock of fruits and rice. 'How many kinds of rice are there?' the old rat ascertained, 'and how many species of fruits?' 'Rice and beans,' the young rat rejoined, 'how many barns-full there are, I can't remember; but in the way of fruits there are five kinds: 1st, red dates; 2nd, chestnuts; 3rd, ground nuts; 4th, water caltrops, and 5th, scented taros.' At this report the old rat was so much elated that he promptly detailed rats to go forth; and as he drew the mandatory arrow, and inquired who would go and steal the rice, a rat readily received the order and went off to rob the rice. Drawing another mandatory arrow, he asked who would go and abstract the beans, when once more a rat took over the arrow and started to steal the beans; and one by one subsequently received each an arrow and started on his errand. There only remained the scented taros, so that picking again a mandatory arrow, he ascertained who would go and carry away the taros: whereupon a very puny and very delicate rat was heard to assent. 'I would like,' he said, 'to go and steal the scented taros.' The old rat and all the swarm of rats, upon noticing his state, feared that he would not be sufficiently expert, and apprehending at the same time that he was too weakly and too devoid of energy, they one and all would not allow him to proceed. 'Though I be young in years and though my frame be delicate,' the wee rat expostulated, 'my devices are unlimited, my talk is glib and my designs deep and farseeing; and I feel convinced that, on this errand, I shall be more ingenious in pilfering than any of them.' 'How could you be more ingenious than they?' the whole company of rats asked. 'I won't,' explained the young rat, 'follow their example, and go straight to work and steal, but by simply shaking my body, and transforming myself, I shall metamorphose myself into a taro, and roll myself among the heap of taros, so that people will not be able to detect me, and to hear me; whereupon I shall stealthily, by means of the magic art of dividing my body into many, begin the removal, and little by little transfer the whole lot away, and will not this be far more ingenious than any direct pilfering or forcible abstraction?' After the whole swarm of rats had listened to what he had to say, they, with one voice, exclaimed: 'Excellent it is indeed, but what is this art of metamorphosis we wonder? Go forth you may, but first transform yourself and let us see you.' At these words the young rat laughed. 'This isn't a hard task!' he observed, 'wait till I transform myself.'</p>
<p>&quot;Having done speaking, he shook his body and shouted out 'transform,' when he was converted into a young girl, most beauteous and with a most lovely face.</p>
<p>&quot;'You've transformed yourself into the wrong thing,' all the rats promptly added deridingly; 'you said that you were to become a fruit, and how is it that you've turned into a young lady?'</p>
<p>&quot;The young rat in its original form rejoined with a sneering smile: 'You all lack, I maintain, experience of the world; what you simply are aware of is that this fruit is the scented taro, but have no idea that the young daughter of Mr. Lin, of the salt tax, is, in real truth, a genuine scented taro.'&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü having listened to this story, turned herself round and raising herself, she observed laughing, while she pushed Pao-yü: &quot;I'll take that mouth of yours and pull it to pieces! Now I see that you've been imposing upon me.&quot;</p>
<p>With these words on her lips, she readily gave him a pinch, and Pao-yü hastened to plead for mercy. &quot;My dear cousin,&quot; he said, &quot;spare me; I won't presume to do it again; and it's when I came to perceive this perfume of yours, that I suddenly bethought myself of this old story.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You freely indulge in abusing people,&quot; Tai-yü added with a smile, &quot;and then go on to say that it's an old story.&quot;</p>
<p>But hardly had she concluded this remark before they caught sight of Pao-ch'ai walk in. &quot;Who has been telling old stories?&quot; she asked with a beaming face; &quot;do let me also hear them.&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü pressed her at once into a seat. &quot;Just see for yourself who else besides is here!&quot; she smiled; &quot;he goes in for profuse abuses and then maintains that it's an old story!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is it indeed cousin Pao-yü?&quot; Pao-ch'ai remarked. &quot;Well, one can't feel surprised at his doing it; for many have ever been the stories stored up in his brain. The only pity is that when he should make use of old stories, he invariably forgets them! To-day, he can easily enough recall them to mind, but in the stanza of the other night on the banana leaves, when he should have remembered them, he couldn't after all recollect what really stared him in the face! and while every one else seemed so cool, he was in such a flurry that he actually perspired! And yet, at this moment, he happens once again to have a memory!&quot;</p>
<p>At these words, Tai-yü laughed. &quot;O-mi-to-fu!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;You are indeed my very good cousin! But you've also (to Pao-yü) come across your match. And this makes it clear that requital and retribution never fail or err.&quot;</p>
<p>She had just reached this part of her sentence, when in Pao-yü's rooms was heard a continuous sound of wrangling; but as what transpired is not yet known, the ensuing chapter will explain.</p>

<p>  Wang Hsi-feng with earnest words upbraids Mrs. Chao's jealous notions.<br>
  Lin Tai-yü uses specious language to make sport of Shih Hsiang-yün's<br>
      querulous tone of voice.\</p>
<p>But to continue. Pao-yü was in Tai yü's apartments relating about the rat-elves, when Pao-ch'ai entered unannounced, and began to gibe Pao-yü, with trenchant irony: how that on the fifteenth of the first moon, he had shown ignorance of the allusion to the green wax; and the three of them then indulged in that room in mutual poignant satire, for the sake of fun. Pao-yü had been giving way to solicitude lest Tai-yü should, by being bent upon napping soon after her meal, be shortly getting an indigestion, or lest sleep should, at night, be completely dispelled, as neither of these things were conducive to the preservation of good health, when luckily Pao-ch'ai walked in, and they chatted and laughed together; and when Lin Tai-yü at length lost all inclination to dose, he himself then felt composed in his mind. But suddenly they heard clamouring begin in his room, and after they had all lent an ear and listened, Lin Tai-yü was the first to smile and make a remark. &quot;It's your nurse having a row with Hsi Jen!&quot; she said. &quot;Hsi Jen treats her well enough, but that nurse of yours would also like to keep her well under her thumb; she's indeed an old dotard;&quot; and Pao-yü was anxious to go over at once, but Pao-ch'ai laid hold of him and kept him back, suggesting: &quot;It's as well that you shouldn't wrangle with your nurse, for she's quite stupid from old age; and it's but fair, on the contrary, that you should bear with her a little.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know all about that!&quot; Pao-yü rejoined. But having concluded this remark, he walked into his room, where he discovered nurse Li, leaning on her staff, standing in the centre of the floor, abusing Hsi Jen, saying: &quot;You young wench! how utterly unmindful you are of your origin! It's I who've raised you up, and yet, when I came just now, you put on high airs and mighty side, and remained reclining on the stove-couch! You saw me well enough, but you paid not the least heed to me! Your whole heart is set upon acting like a wily enchantress to befool Pao-yü; and you so impose upon Pao-yü that he doesn't notice me, but merely lends an ear to what you people have to say! You're no more than a low girl bought for a few taels and brought in here; and will it ever do that you should be up to your mischievous tricks in this room? But whether you like it or not, I'll drag you out from this, and give you to some mean fellow, and we'll see whether you will still behave like a very imp, and cajole people or not?&quot;</p>
<p>Hsi Jen was, at first, under the simple impression that the nurse was wrath for no other reason than because she remained lying down, and she felt constrained to explain that &quot;she was unwell, that she had just succeeded in perspiring, and that having had her head covered, she hadn't really perceived the old lady;&quot; but when she came subsequently to hear her mention that she imposed upon Pao-yü, and also go so far as to add that she would be given to some mean fellow, she unavoidably experienced both a sense of shame and injury, and found it impossible to restrain herself from beginning to cry.</p>
<p>Pao-yü had, it is true, caught all that had been said, but unable with any propriety to take notice of it, he thought it his duty to explain matters for her. &quot;She's ill,&quot; he observed, &quot;and is taking medicines; and if you don't believe it,&quot; he went on, &quot;well then ask the rest of the servant-girls.&quot;</p>
<p>Nurse Li at these words flew into a more violent dudgeon. &quot;Your sole delight is to screen that lot of sly foxes!&quot; she remarked, &quot;and do you pay any notice to me? No, none at all! and whom would you like me to go and ask; who's it that doesn't back you? and who hasn't been dismounted from her horse by Hsi Jen? I know all about it; but I'll go with you and explain all these matters to our old mistress and my lady; for I've nursed you till I've brought you to this age, and now that you don't feed on milk, you thrust me on one side, and avail yourself of the servant-girls, in your wish to browbeat me.&quot;</p>
<p>As she uttered this remark, she too gave way to tears, but by this time, Tai-yü and Pao-ch'ai had also come over, and they set to work to reassure her. &quot;You, old lady,&quot; they urged, &quot;should bear with them a little, and everything will be right!&quot; And when nurse Li saw these two arrive, she hastened to lay bare her grievances to them; and taking up the question of the dismissal in days gone by, of Hsi Hsüeh, for having drunk some tea, of the cream eaten on the previous day, and other similar matters, she spun a long, interminable yarn.</p>
<p>By a strange coincidence lady Feng was at this moment in the upper rooms, where she had been making up the account of losses and winnings, and upon hearing at the back a continuous sound of shouting and bustling, she readily concluded that nurse Li's old complaint was breaking forth, and that she was finding fault with Pao-yü's servants. But she had, as luck would have it, lost money in gambling on this occasion, so that she was ready to visit her resentment upon others. With hurried step, she forthwith came over, and laying hold of nurse Li, &quot;Nurse,&quot; she said smiling, &quot;don't lose your temper, on a great festival like this, and after our venerable lady has just gone through a day in excellent spirits! You're an old dame, and should, when others get up a row, still do what is right and keep them in proper order; and aren't you, instead of that, aware what good manners imply, that you will start vociferating in this place, and make our dowager lady full of displeasure? Tell me who's not good, and I'll beat her for you; but be quick and come along with me over to my quarters, where a pheasant which they have roasted is scalding hot, and let us go and have a glass of wine!&quot; And as she spoke, she dragged her along and went on her way. &quot;Feng Erh,&quot; she also called, &quot;hold the staff for your old lady Li, and the handkerchief to wipe her tears with!&quot; While nurse Li walked along with lady Feng, her feet scarcely touched the ground, as she kept on saying: &quot;I don't really attach any value to this decrepid existence of mine! and I had rather disregard good manners, have a row and lose face, as it's better, it seems to me, than to put up with the temper of that wench!&quot;</p>
<p>Behind followed Pao-ch'ai and Tai-yü, and at the sight of the way in which lady Feng dealt with her, they both clapped their hands, and exclaimed, laughing, &quot;What piece of luck that this gust of wind has come, and dragged away this old matron!&quot; while Pao-yü nodded his head to and fro and soliloquised with a sigh: &quot;One can neither know whence originates this score; for she will choose the weak one to maltreat; nor can one see what girl has given her offence that she has come to be put in her black books!&quot;</p>
<p>Scarcely had he ended this remark, before Ch'ing Wen, who stood by, put in her word. &quot;Who's gone mad again?&quot; she interposed, &quot;and what good would come by hurting her feelings? But did even any one happen to hurt her, she would have pluck enough to bear the brunt, and wouldn't act so improperly as to involve others!&quot;</p>
<p>Hsi Jen wept, and as she, did so, she drew Pao-yü towards her: &quot;All through my having aggrieved an old nurse,&quot; she urged, &quot;you've now again given umbrage, entirely on my account, to this crowd of people; and isn't this still enough for me to bear but must you also go and drag in third parties?&quot;</p>
<p>When Pao-yü realised that to this sickness of hers, had also been superadded all these annoyances, he promptly stifled his resentment, suppressed his voice and consoled her so far as to induce her to lie down again to perspire. And when he further noticed how scalding like soup and burning like fire she was, he himself watched by her, and reclining by her side, he tried to cheer her, saying: &quot;All you must do is to take good care of your ailment; and don't give your mind to those trifling matters, and get angry.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Were I,&quot; Hsi Jen smiled sardonically, &quot;to lose my temper over such concerns, would I be able to stand one moment longer in this room? The only thing is that if she goes on, day after day, doing nothing else than clamour in this manner, how can she let people get along? But you rashly go and hurt people's feelings for our sakes; but they'll bear it in mind, and when they find an opportunity, they'll come out with what's easy enough to say, but what's not pleasant to hear, and how will we all feel then?&quot;</p>
<p>While her mouth gave utterance to these words, she could not stop her tears from running; but fearful, on the other hand, lest Pao-yü should be annoyed, she felt compelled to again strain every nerve to repress them. But in a short while, the old matrons employed for all sorts of duties, brought in some mixture of two drugs; and, as Pao-yü noticed that she was just on the point of perspiring, he did not allow her to get up, but readily taking it up to her, she immediately swallowed it, with her head still on her pillow; whereupon he gave speedy directions to the young servant-maids to lay her stove-couch in order.</p>
<p>&quot;Whether you mean to have anything to eat or not,&quot; Hsi Jen advised, &quot;you should after all sit for a time with our old mistress and our lady, and have a romp with the young ladies; after which you can come back again; while I, by quietly keeping lying down, will also feel the better.&quot;</p>
<p>When Pao-yü heard this suggestion, he had no help but to accede, and, after she had divested herself of her hair-pins and earrings, and he saw her lie down, he betook himself into the drawing-rooms, where he had his repast with old lady Chia. But the meal over, her ladyship felt still disposed to play at cards with the nurses, who had looked after the household for many years; and Pao-yü, bethinking himself of Hsi Jen, hastened to return to his apartments; where seeing that Hsi Jen was drowsily falling asleep, he himself would have wished to go to bed, but the hour was yet early. And as about this time Ch'ing Wen, I Hsia, Ch'in Wen, Pi Hen had all, in their desire of getting some excitement, started in search of Yüan Yang, Hu Po and their companions, to have a romp with them, and he espied She Yüeh alone in the outer room, having a game of dominoes by lamp-light, Pao-yü inquired full of smiles: &quot;How is it you don't go with them?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've no money,&quot; She Yüeh replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the bed,&quot; continued Pao-yü, &quot;is heaped up all that money, and isn't it enough yet for you to lose from?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Had we all gone to play,&quot; She Yüeh added, &quot;to whom would the charge of this apartment have been handed over? That other one is sick again, and the whole room is above, one mass of lamps, and below, full of fire; and all those old matrons, ancient as the heavens, should, after all their exertions in waiting upon you from morning to night, be also allowed some rest; while the young servant girls, on the other hand, have likewise been on duty the whole day long, and shouldn't they even at this hour be left to go and have some distraction? and that's why I am in here on watch.&quot;</p>
<p>When Pao-yü heard these words, which demonstrated distinctly that she was another Hsi Jen, he consequently put on a smile and remarked: &quot;I'll sit in here, so you had better set your mind at ease and go!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Since you remain in here, there's less need for me to go,&quot; resumed She<br>
Yüeh, &quot;for we two can chat and play and laugh; and won't that be nice?&quot;\</p>
<p>&quot;What can we two do? it will be awfully dull! but never mind,&quot; Pao-yü rejoined; &quot;this morning you said that your head itched, and now that you have nothing to do, I may as well comb it for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes! do so!&quot; readily assented She Yüeh, upon catching what he suggested; and while still speaking, she brought over the dressing-case containing a set of small drawers and looking-glass, and taking off her ornaments, she dishevelled her hair; whereupon Pao-yü picked up the fine comb and passed it repeatedly through her hair; but he had only combed it three or five times, when he perceived Ch'ing Wen hurriedly walk in to fetch some money. As soon as she caught sight of them both: &quot;You haven't as yet drunk from the marriage cup,&quot; she said with a smile full of irony, &quot;and have you already put up your hair?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Now that you've come, let me also comb yours for you,&quot; Pao-yü continued.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not blessed with such excessive good fortune!&quot; Ch'ing Wen retorted, and as she uttered these words, she took the money, and forthwith dashing the portiere after her, she quitted the room.</p>
<p>Pao-yü stood at the back of She Yüeh, and She Yüeh sat opposite the glass, so that the two of them faced each other in it, and Pao-yü readily observed as he gazed in the glass, &quot;In the whole number of rooms she's the only one who has a glib tongue!&quot;</p>
<p>She Yüeh at these words hastily waved her hand towards the inside of the glass, and Pao-yü understood the hint; and suddenly a sound of &quot;hu&quot; was heard from the portiere, and Ch'ing Wen ran in once again.</p>
<p>&quot;How have I got a glib tongue?&quot; she inquired; &quot;it would be well for us to explain ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Go after your business, and have done,&quot; She Yüeh interposed laughingly; &quot;what's the use of your coming and asking questions of people?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Will you also screen him?&quot; Ch'ing Wen smiled significantly; &quot;I know all about your secret doings, but wait until I've got back my capital, and we'll then talk matters over!&quot;</p>
<p>With this remark still on her lips, she straightway quitted the room, and during this while, Pao-yü having finished combing her hair, asked She Yüeh to quietly wait upon him, while he went to sleep, as he would not like to disturb Hsi Jen.</p>
<p>Of the whole night there is nothing to record. But the next day, when he got up at early dawn, Hsi Jen had already perspired, during the night, so that she felt considerably lighter and better; but limiting her diet to a little rice soup, she remained quiet and nursed herself, and Pao-yü was so relieved in mind that he came, after his meal, over on this side to his aunt Hsüeh's on a saunter. The season was the course of the first moon, and the school was shut up for the new year holidays; while in the inner chambers the girls had put by their needlework, and were all having a time of leisure, and hence it was that when Chia Huan too came over in search of distraction, he discovered Pao-ch'ai, Hsiang Ling, Ying Erh, the three of them, in the act of recreating themselves by playing at chess. Chia Huan, at the sight of them, also wished to join in their games; and Pao-ch'ai, who had always looked upon him with, in fact, the same eye as she did Pao-yü, and with no different sentiment of any kind, pressed him to come up, upon hearing that he was on this occasion desirous to play; and, when he had seated himself together with them, they began to gamble, staking each time a pile of ten cash. The first time, he was the winner, and he felt supremely elated at heart, but as it happened that he subsequently lost in several consecutive games he soon became a prey to considerable distress. But in due course came the game in which it was his turn to cast the dice, and, if in throwing, he got seven spots, he stood to win, but he was likewise bound to be a winner were he to turn up six; and when Ying Erh had turned up three spots and lost, he consequently took up the dice, and dashing them with spite, one of them settled at five; and, as the other reeled wildly about, Ying Erh clapped her hands, and kept on shouting, &quot;one spot;&quot; while Chia Huan at once gazed with fixed eye and cried at random: &quot;It's six, it's seven, it's eight!&quot; But the dice, as it happened, turned up at one spot, and Chia Huan was so exasperated that putting out his hand, he speedily made a snatch at the dice, and eventually was about to lay hold of the money, arguing that it was six spot. But Ying Erh expostulated, &quot;It was distinctly an ace,&quot; she said. And as Pao-ch'ai noticed how distressed Chia Huan was, she forthwith cast a glance at Ying Erh and observed: &quot;The older you get, the less manners you have! Is it likely that gentlemen will cheat you? and don't you yet put down the money?&quot;</p>
<p>Ying Erh felt her whole heart much aggrieved, but as she heard Pao-ch'ai make these remarks, she did not presume to utter a sound, and as she was under the necessity of laying down the cash, she muttered to herself: &quot;This one calls himself a gentleman, and yet cheats us of these few cash, for which I myself even have no eye! The other day when I played with Mr. Pao-yü, he lost ever so many, and yet he did not distress himself! and what remained of the cash were besides snatched away by a few servant-girls, but all he did was to smile, that's all!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-ch'ai did not allow her time to complete what she had to say, but there and then called her to account and made her desist; whereupon Chia Huan exclaimed: &quot;How can I compare with Pao-yü; you all fear him, and keep on good terms with him, while you all look down upon me for not being the child of my lady.&quot; And as he uttered these words, he at once gave way to tears.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear cousin,&quot; Pao-ch'ai hastened to advise him, &quot;leave off at once language of this kind, for people will laugh at you;&quot; and then went on to scold Ying Erh, when Pao-yü just happened to come in. Perceiving him in this plight, &quot;What is the matter?&quot; he asked; but Chia Huan had not the courage to say anything.</p>
<p>Pao-ch'ai was well aware of the custom, which prevailed in their family, that younger brothers lived in respect of the elder brothers, but she was not however cognisant of the fact that Pao-yü would not that any one should entertain any fear of him. His idea being that elder as well as younger brothers had, all alike, father and mother to admonish them, and that there was no need for any of that officiousness, which, instead of doing good gave, on the contrary, rise to estrangement. &quot;Besides,&quot; (he reasoned,) &quot;I'm the offspring of the primary wife, while he's the son of the secondary wife, and, if by treating him as leniently as I have done, there are still those to talk about me, behind my back, how could I exercise any control over him?&quot; But besides these, there were other still more foolish notions, which he fostered in his mind; but what foolish notions they were can you, reader, guess? As a result of his growing up, from his early youth, among a crowd of girls, of whom, in the way of sister, there was Yüan Ch'un, of cousins, from his paternal uncle's side, there were Ying Ch'un, and Hsi Ch'un, and of relatives also there were Shih Hsiang-yün, Lin Tai-yü, Hsüeh Pao-ch'ai and the rest, he, in due course, resolved in his mind that the divine and unsullied virtue of Heaven and earth was only implanted in womankind, and that men were no more than feculent dregs and foul dirt. And for this reason it was that men were without discrimination, considered by him as so many filthy objects, which might or might not exist; while the relationships of father, paternal uncles, and brothers, he did not however presume to disregard, as these were among the injunctions bequeathed by the holy man, and he felt bound to listen to a few of their precepts. But to the above causes must be assigned the fact that, among his brothers, he did no more than accomplish the general purport of the principle of human affections; bearing in mind no thought whatever that he himself was a human being of the male sex, and that it was his duty to be an example to his younger brothers. And this is why Chia Huan and the others entertained no respect for him, though in their veneration for dowager lady Chia, they yielded to him to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Pao-ch'ai harboured fears lest, on this occasion, Pao-yü should call him to book, and put him out of face, and she there and then lost no time in taking Chia Huan's part with a view to screening him.</p>
<p>&quot;In this felicitous first moon what are you blubbering for?&quot; Pao-yü inquired, &quot;if this place isn't nice, why then go somewhere else to play. But from reading books, day after day, you've studied so much that you've become quite a dunce. If this thing, for instance, isn't good, that must, of course, be good, so then discard this and take up that, but is it likely that by sticking to this thing and crying for a while that it will become good? You came originally with the idea of reaping some fun, and you've instead provoked yourself to displeasure, and isn't it better then that you should be off at once.&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Huan upon hearing these words could not but come back to his quarters; and Mrs. Chao noticing the frame of mind in which he was felt constrained to inquire: &quot;Where is it that you've been looked down upon by being made to fill up a hole, and being trodden under foot?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was playing with cousin Pao-ch'ai,&quot; Chia Huan readily replied, &quot;when Ying Erh insulted me, and deprived me of my money, and brother Pao-yü drove me away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ts'ui!&quot; exclaimed Mrs. Chao, &quot;who bade you (presume so high) as to get up into that lofty tray? You low and barefaced thing! What place is there that you can't go to and play; and who told you to run over there and bring upon yourself all this shame?&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, lady Feng was, by a strange coincidence, passing outside under the window; so that every word reached her ear, and she speedily asked from outside the window: &quot;What are you up to in this happy first moon? These brothers are, really, but mere children, and will you just for a slight mistake, go on preaching to him! what's the use of coming out with all you've said? Let him go wherever he pleases; for there are still our lady and Mr. Chia Cheng to keep him in order. But you go and sputter him with your gigantic mouth; he's at present a master, and if there be anything wrong about him, there are, after all, those to rate him; and what business is that of yours? Brother Huan, come out with you, and follow me and let us go and enjoy ourselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Huan had ever been in greater fear and trembling of lady Feng, than of madame Wang, so that when her summons reached his ear, he hurriedly went out, while Mrs. Chao, on the other hand, did not venture to breathe a single word.</p>
<p>&quot;You too,&quot; resumed lady Feng, addressing Chia Huan; &quot;are a thing devoid of all natural spirit! I've often told you that if you want to eat, drink, play, or laugh, you were quite free to go and play with whatever female cousin, male cousin, or sister-in-law you choose to disport yourself with; but you won't listen to my words. On the contrary, you let all these persons teach you to be depraved in your heart, perverse in your mind, to be sly, artful, and domineering; and you've, besides, no respect for your own self, but will go with that low-bred lot! and your perverse purpose is to begrudge people's preferences! But what you've lost are simply a few cash, and do you behave in this manner? How much did you lose?&quot; she proceeded to ask Chia Huan; and Chia Huan, upon hearing this question, felt constrained to obey, by saying something in the way of a reply. &quot;I've lost,&quot; he explained, &quot;some hundred or two hundred cash.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You have,&quot; rejoined lady Feng, &quot;the good fortune of being a gentleman, and do you make such a fuss for the loss of a hundred or two hundred cash!&quot; and turning her head round, &quot;Feng Erh,&quot; she added, &quot;go and fetch a thousand cash; and as the girls are all playing at the back, take him along to go and play. And if again by and by, you're so mean and deceitful, I shall, first of all, beat you, and then tell some one to report it at school, and won't your skin be flayed for you? All because of this want of respect of yours, your elder cousin is so angry with you that his teeth itch; and were it not that I prevent him, he would hit you with his foot in the stomach and kick all your intestines out! Get away,&quot; she then cried; whereupon Chia Huan obediently followed Feng Erh, and taking the money he went all by himself to play with Ying Ch'un and the rest; where we shall leave him without another word.</p>
<p>But to return to Pao-yü. He was just amusing himself and laughing with Pao-ch'ai, when at an unexpected moment, he heard some one announce that Miss Shih had come. At these words, Pao-yü rose, and was at once going off when &quot;Wait,&quot; shouted Pao-ch'ai with a smile, &quot;and we'll go over together and see her.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, she descended from the stove-couch, and came, in company with Pao-yü, to dowager lady Chia's on this side, where they saw Shih Hsiang-yün laughing aloud, and talking immoderately; and upon catching sight of them both, she promptly inquired after their healths, and exchanged salutations.</p>
<p>Lin Tai-yü just happened to be standing by, and having set the question to Pao-yü &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; &quot;I come from cousin Pao-ch'ai's rooms,&quot; Pao-yü readily replied.</p>
<p>Tai-yü gave a sardonic smile. &quot;What I maintain is this,&quot; she rejoined, &quot;that lucky enough for you, you were detained over there; otherwise, you would long ago have, at once, come flying in here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Am I only free to play with you?&quot; Pao-yü inquired, &quot;and to dispel your ennui! I simply went over to her place for a run, and that quite casually, and will you insinuate all these things?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Your words are quite devoid of sense,&quot; Tai-yü added; &quot;whether you go or not what's that to me? neither did I tell you to give me any distraction; you're quite at liberty from this time forth not to pay any notice to me!&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, she flew into a high dudgeon and rushed back into her room; but Pao-yü promptly followed in her footsteps: &quot;Here you are again in a huff,&quot; he urged, &quot;and all for no reason! Had I even passed any remark that I shouldn't, you should anyhow have still sat in there, and chatted and laughed with the others for a while; instead of that, you come again to sit and mope all alone!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Are you my keeper?&quot; Tai-yü expostulated.</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't, of course,&quot; Pao-yü smiled, &quot;presume to exercise any influence over you; but the only thing is that you are doing your own health harm!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I do ruin my health,&quot; Tai-yü rejoined, &quot;and I die, it's my own lookout! what's that to do with you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's the good,&quot; protested Pao-yü, &quot;of talking in this happy first moon of dying and of living?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I <em>will</em> say die,&quot; insisted Tai-yü, &quot;die now, at this very moment! but you're afraid of death; and you may live a long life of a hundred years, but what good will that be!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If all we do is to go on nagging in this way,&quot; Pao-yü remarked smiling, &quot;will I any more be afraid to die? on the contrary, it would be better to die, and be free!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Quite so!&quot; continued Tai-yü with alacrity, &quot;if we go on nagging in this way, it would be better for me to die, and that you should be free of me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I speak of my own self dying,&quot; Pao-yü added, &quot;so don't misunderstand my words and accuse people wrongly.&quot;</p>
<p>While he was as yet speaking, Pao-ch'ai entered the room: &quot;Cousin Shih is waiting for you;&quot; she said; and with these words, she hastily pushed Pao-yü on, and they walked away.</p>
<p>Tai-yü, meanwhile, became more and more a prey to resentment; and disconsolate as she felt, she shed tears in front of the window. But not time enough had transpired to allow two cups of tea to be drunk, before Pao-yü came back again. At the sight of him, Tai-yü sobbed still more fervently and incessantly, and Pao-yü realising the state she was in, and knowing well enough how arduous a task it would be to bring her round, began to join together a hundred, yea a thousand kinds of soft phrases and tender words to console her. But at an unforeseen moment, and before he could himself open his mouth, he heard Tai-yü anticipate him.</p>
<p>&quot;What have you come back again for?&quot; she asked. &quot;Let me die or live, as I please, and have done! You've really got at present some one to play with you, one who, compared with me, is able to read and able to compose, able to write, to speak, as well as to joke, one too who for fear lest you should have ruffled your temper dragged you away: and what do you return here for now?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü, after listening to all she had to say, hastened to come up to her. &quot;Is it likely,&quot; he observed in a low tone of voice, &quot;that an intelligent person like you isn't so much as aware that near relatives can't be separated by a distant relative, and a remote friend set aside an old friend! I'm stupid, there's no gainsaying, but I do anyhow understand what these two sentiments imply. You and I are, in the first place, cousins on my father's sister's side; while sister Pao-ch'ai and I are two cousins on mother's sides, so that, according to the degrees of relationship, she's more distant than yourself. In the second place, you came here first, and we two have our meals at one table and sleep in one bed, having ever since our youth grown up together; while she has only recently come, and how could I ever distance you on her account?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ts'ui!&quot; Tai-yü exclaimed. &quot;Will I forsooth ever make you distance her! who and what kind of person have I become to do such a thing? What (I said) was prompted by my own motives.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I too,&quot; Pao-yü urged, &quot;made those remarks prompted by my own heart's motives, and do you mean to say that your heart can only read the feelings of your own heart, and has no idea whatsoever of my own?&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü at these words, lowered her head and said not a word. But after a long interval, &quot;You only know,&quot; she continued, &quot;how to feel bitter against people for their action in censuring you: but you don't, after all, know that you yourself provoke people to such a degree, that it's hard for them to put up with it! Take for instance the weather of to-day as an example. It's distinctly very cold, to-day, and yet, how is it that you are so contrary as to go and divest yourself of the pelisse with the bluish breast-fur overlapping the cloth?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Why say I didn't wear it?&quot; Pao-yü smilingly observed. &quot;I did, but seeing you get angry I felt suddenly in such a terrible blaze, that I at once took it off!&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü heaved a sigh. &quot;You'll by and by catch a cold,&quot; she remarked, &quot;and then you'll again have to starve, and vociferate for something to eat!&quot;</p>
<p>While these two were having this colloquy, Hsiang-yün was seen to walk in! &quot;You two, Ai cousin and cousin Lin,&quot; she ventured jokingly, &quot;are together playing every day, and though I've managed to come after ever so much trouble, you pay no heed to me at all!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's invariably the rule,&quot; Tai-yü retorted smilingly, &quot;that those who have a defect in their speech will insist upon talking; she can't even come out correctly with 'Erh' (secundus) cousin, and keeps on calling him 'Ai' cousin, 'Ai' cousin! And by and by when you play 'Wei Ch'i' you're sure also to shout out yao, ai, (instead of erh), san; (one, two, three).&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü laughed. &quot;If you imitate her,&quot; he interposed, &quot;and get into that habit, you'll also begin to bite your tongue when you talk.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She won't make even the slightest allowance for any one,&quot; Hsiang-yün rejoined; &quot;her sole idea being to pick out others' faults. You may readily be superior to any mortal being, but you shouldn't, after all, offend against what's right and make fun of every person you come across! But I'll point out some one, and if you venture to jeer her, I'll at once submit to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who is it?&quot; Tai-yü vehemently inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;If you do have the courage,&quot; Hsiang-yün answered, &quot;to pick out cousin<br>
Pao-ch'ai's faults, you then may well be held to be first-rate!&quot;\</p>
<p>Tai-yü after hearing these words, gave a sarcastic smile. &quot;I was wondering,&quot; she observed, &quot;who it was. Is it indeed she? How could I ever presume to pick out hers?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü allowed her no time to finish, but hastened to say something to interrupt the conversation.</p>
<p>&quot;I couldn't, of course, during the whole of this my lifetime,&quot; Hsiang-yün laughed, &quot;attain your standard! but my earnest wish is that by and by should be found for you, cousin Lin, a husband, who bites his tongue when he speaks, so that you should every minute and second listen to 'ai-ya-os!' O-mi-to-fu, won't then your reward be manifest to my eyes!&quot;</p>
<p>As she made this remark, they all burst out laughing heartily, and<br>
Hsiang-yün speedily turned herself round and ran away.\</p>
<p>But reader, do you want to know the sequel? Well, then listen to the explanation given in the next chapter.</p>
