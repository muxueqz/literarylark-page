<p>  The eminent Hsi Jen, with winsome ways, rails at Pao-yü, with a view<br>
      to exhortation.<br>
  The beauteous P'ing Erh, with soft words, screens Chia Lien.\</p>
<p>But to resume our story. When Shih Hsiang-yün ran out of the room, she was all in a flutter lest Lin Tai-yü should catch her up; but Pao-yü, who came after her, readily shouted out, &quot;You'll trip and fall. How ever could she come up to you?&quot;</p>
<p>Lin Tai-yü went in pursuit of her as far as the entrance, when she was impeded from making further progress by Pao-yü, who stretched his arms out against the posts of the door.</p>
<p>&quot;Were I to spare Yün Erh, I couldn't live!&quot; Lin Tai-yü exclaimed, as she tugged at his arms. But Hsiang-yün, perceiving that Pao-yü obstructed the door, and surmising that Tai-yü could not come out, speedily stood still. &quot;My dear cousin,&quot; she smilingly pleaded, &quot;do let me off this time!&quot;</p>
<p>But it just happened that Pao-ch'ai, who was coming along, was at the back of Hsiang-yün, and with a face also beaming with smiles: &quot;I advise you both,&quot; she said, &quot;to leave off out of respect for cousin Pao-yü, and have done.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I don't agree to that,&quot; Tai-yü rejoined; &quot;are you people, pray, all of one mind to do nothing but make fun of me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who ventures to make fun of you?&quot; Pao-yü observed advisingly; &quot;and hadn't you made sport of her, would she have presumed to have said anything about you?&quot;</p>
<p>While this quartet were finding it an arduous task to understand one another, a servant came to invite them to have their repast, and they eventually crossed over to the front side, and as it was already time for the lamps to be lit, madame Wang, widow Li Wan, lady Feng, Ying Ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un and the other cousins, adjourned in a body to dowager lady Chia's apartments on this side, where the whole company spent a while in a chat on irrelevant topics, after which they each returned to their rooms and retired to bed. Hsiang-yün, as of old, betook herself to Tai-yü's quarters to rest, and Pao-yü escorted them both into their apartment, and it was after the hour had already past the second watch, and Hsi Jen had come and pressed him several times, that he at length returned to his own bedroom and went to sleep. The next morning, as soon as it was daylight, he threw his clothes over him, put on his low shoes and came over into Tai-yü's room, where he however saw nothing of the two girls Tzu Chüan and Ts'ui Lu, as there was no one else here in there besides his two cousins, still reclining under the coverlets. Tai-yü was closely wrapped in a quilt of almond-red silk, and lying quietly, with closed eyes fast asleep; while Shih Hsiang-yün, with her handful of shiny hair draggling along the edge of the pillow, was covered only up to the chest, and outside the coverlet rested her curved snow-white arm, with the gold bracelets, which she had on.</p>
<p>At the sight of her, Pao-yü heaved a sigh. &quot;Even when asleep,&quot; he soliloquised, &quot;she can't be quiet! but by and by, when the wind will have blown on her, she'll again shout that her shoulder is sore!&quot; With these words, he gently covered her, but Lin Tai-yü had already awoke out of her sleep, and becoming aware that there was some one about, she promptly concluded that it must, for a certainty, be Pao-yü, and turning herself accordingly round, and discovering at a glance that the truth was not beyond her conjectures, she observed: &quot;What have you run over to do at this early hour?&quot; to which question Pao-yü replied: &quot;Do you call this early? but get up and see for yourself!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;First quit the room,&quot; Tai-yü suggested, &quot;and let us get up!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü thereupon made his exit into the ante-chamber, and Tai-yü jumped out of bed, and awoke Hsiang-yün. When both of them had put on their clothes, Pao-yü re-entered and took a seat by the side of the toilet table; whence he beheld Tzu-chüan and Hsüeh Yen walk in and wait upon them, as they dressed their hair and performed their ablutions. Hsiang-yün had done washing her face, and Ts'üi Lü at once took the remaining water and was about to throw it away, when Pao-yü interposed, saying: &quot;Wait, I'll avail myself of this opportunity to wash too and finish with it, and thus save myself the trouble of having again to go over!&quot; Speaking the while, he hastily came forward, and bending his waist, he washed his face twice with two handfuls of water, and when Tzu Chüan went over to give him the scented soap, Pao-yü added: &quot;In this basin, there's a good deal of it, and there's no need of rubbing any more!&quot; He then washed his face with two more handfuls, and forthwith asked for a towel, and Ts'üi Lü exclaimed: &quot;What! have you still got this failing? when will you turn a new leaf?&quot; But Pao-yü paid not so much as any heed to her, and there and then called for some salt, with which he rubbed his teeth, and rinsed his mouth. When he had done, he perceived that Hsiang-yün had already finished combing her hair, and speedily coming up to her, he put on a smile, and said: &quot;My dear cousin, comb my hair for me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This can't be done!&quot; Hsiang-yün objected.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear cousin,&quot; Pao-yü continued smirkingly, &quot;how is it that you combed it for me in former times?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've forgotten now how to comb it!&quot; Hsiang-yün replied.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not, after all, going out of doors,&quot; Pao-yü observed, &quot;nor will I wear a hat or frontlet, so that all that need be done is to plait a few queues, that's all!&quot; Saying this, he went on to appeal to her in a thousand and one endearing terms, so that Hsiang-yün had no alternative, but to draw his head nearer to her and to comb one queue after another, and as when he stayed at home he wore no hat, nor had, in fact, any tufted horns, she merely took the short surrounding hair from all four sides, and twisting it into small tufts, she collected it together over the hair on the crown of the head, and plaited a large queue, binding it fast with red ribbon; while from the root of the hair to the end of the queue, were four pearls in a row, below which, in the way of a tip, was suspended a golden pendant.</p>
<p>&quot;Of these pearls there are only three,&quot; Hsiang-yün remarked as she went on plaiting; &quot;this isn't one like them; I remember these were all of one kind, and how is it that there's one short?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've lost one,&quot; Pao-yü rejoined.</p>
<p>&quot;It must have dropped,&quot; Hsiang-yün added, &quot;when you went out of doors, and been picked up by some one when you were off your guard; and he's now, instead of you, the richer for it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;One can neither tell whether it has been really lost,&quot; Tai-yü, who stood by, interposed, smiling the while sarcastically; &quot;nor could one say whether it hasn't been given away to some one to be mounted in some trinket or other and worn!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü made no reply; but set to work, seeing that the two sides of the dressing table were all full of toilet boxes and other such articles, taking up those that came under his hand and examining them. Grasping unawares a box of cosmetic, which was within his reach, he would have liked to have brought it to his lips, but he feared again lest Hsiang-yün should chide him. While he was hesitating whether to do so or not, Hsiang-yün, from behind, stretched forth her arm and gave him a smack, which sent the cosmetic flying from his hand, as she cried out: &quot;You good-for-nothing! when will you mend those weaknesses of yours!&quot; But hardly had she had time to complete this remark, when she caught sight of Hsi Jen walk in, who upon perceiving this state of things, became aware that he was already combed and washed, and she felt constrained to go back and attend to her own coiffure and ablutions. But suddenly, she saw Pao-ch'ai come in and inquire: &quot;Where's cousin Pao-yü gone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you mean to say,&quot; Hsi Jen insinuated with a sardonic smile, &quot;that your cousin Pao-yü has leisure to stay at home?&quot;</p>
<p>When Pao-ch'ai heard these words, she inwardly comprehended her meaning, and when she further heard Hsi Jen remark with a sigh: &quot;Cousins may well be on intimate terms, but they should also observe some sort of propriety; and they shouldn't night and day romp together; and no matter how people may tender advice it's all like so much wind blowing past the ears.&quot; Pao-ch'ai began, at these remarks, to cogitate within her mind: &quot;May I not, possibly, have been mistaken in my estimation of this girl; for to listen to her words, she would really seem to have a certain amount of <em>savoir faire</em>!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-ch'ai thereupon took a seat on the stove-couch, and quietly, in the course of their conversation on one thing and another, she managed to ascertain her age, her native village and other such particulars, and then setting her mind diligently to put, on the sly, her conversation and mental capacity to the test, she discovered how deeply worthy she was to be respected and loved. But in a while Pao-yü arrived, and Pao-ch'ai at once quitted the apartment.</p>
<p>&quot;How is it,&quot; Pao-yü at once inquired, &quot;that cousin Pao-ch'ai was chatting along with you so lustily, and that as soon as she saw me enter, she promptly ran away?&quot;</p>
<p>Hsi Jen did not make any reply to his first question, and it was only when he had repeated it that Hsi Jen remarked: &quot;Do you ask me? How can I know what goes on between you two?&quot;</p>
<p>When Pao-yü heard these words, and he noticed that the look on her face was so unlike that of former days, he lost no time in putting on a smile and asking: &quot;Why is it that you too are angry in real earnest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How could I presume to get angry!&quot; Hsi Jen rejoined smiling indifferently; &quot;but you mustn't, from this day forth, put your foot into this room! and as you have anyhow people to wait on you, you shouldn't come again to make use of my services, for I mean to go and attend to our old mistress, as in days of old.&quot;</p>
<p>With this remark still on her lips, she lay herself down on the stove-couch and closed her eyes. When Pao-yü perceived the state of mind she was in, he felt deeply surprised and could not refrain from coming forward and trying to cheer her up. But Hsi Jen kept her eyes closed and paid no heed to him, so that Pao-yü was quite at a loss how to act. But espying She Yüeh enter the room, he said with alacrity: &quot;What's up with your sister?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do I know?&quot; answered She Yüeh, &quot;examine your own self and you'll readily know!&quot;</p>
<p>After these words had been heard by Pao-yü, he gazed vacantly for some time, feeling the while very unhappy; but raising himself impetuously: &quot;Well!&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;if you don't notice me, all right, I too will go to sleep,&quot; and as he spoke he got up, and, descending from the couch, he betook himself to his own bed and went to sleep. Hsi Jen noticing that he had not budged for ever so long, and that he faintly snored, presumed that he must have fallen fast asleep, so she speedily rose to her feet, and, taking a wrapper, came over and covered him. But a sound of &quot;hu&quot; reached her ear, as Pao-yü promptly threw it off and once again closed his eyes and feigned sleep. Hsi Jen distinctly grasped his idea and, forthwith nodding her head, she smiled coldly. &quot;You really needn't lose your temper! but from this time forth, I'll become mute, and not say one word to you; and what if I do?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü could not restrain himself from rising. &quot;What have I been up to again,&quot; he asked, &quot;that you're once more at me with your advice? As far as your advice goes, it's all well and good; but just now without one word of counsel, you paid no heed to me when I came in, but, flying into a huff, you went to sleep. Nor could I make out what it was all about, and now here you are again maintaining that I'm angry. But when did I hear you, pray, give me a word of advice of any kind?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doesn't your mind yet see for itself?&quot; Hsi Jen replied; &quot;and do you still expect me to tell you?&quot;</p>
<p>While they were disputing, dowager lady Chia sent a servant to call him to his repast, and he thereupon crossed over to the front; but after he had hurriedly swallowed a few bowls of rice, he returned to his own apartment, where he discovered Hsi Jen reclining on the outer stove-couch, while She Yüeh was playing with the dominoes by her side. Pao-yü had been ever aware of the intimacy which existed between She Yüeh and Hsi Jen, so that paying not the slightest notice to even She Yüeh, he raised the soft portiere and straightway walked all alone into the inner apartment. She Yüeh felt constrained to follow him in, but Pao-yü at once pushed her out, saying: &quot;I don't venture to disturb you two;&quot; so that She Yüeh had no alternative but to leave the room with a smiling countenance, and to bid two young waiting-maids go in. Pao-yü took hold of a book and read for a considerable time in a reclining position; but upon raising his head to ask for some tea, he caught sight of a couple of waiting-maids, standing below; the one of whom, slightly older than the other, was exceedingly winsome.</p>
<p>&quot;What's your name?&quot; Pao-yü eagerly inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm called Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance),&quot; that waiting-maid rejoined simperingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Who gave you this name?&quot; Pao-yü went on to ask.</p>
<p>&quot;I went originally under the name of Yün Hsiang (Gum Sandarac),&quot; added<br>
Hui Hsiang, &quot;but Miss Hua it was who changed it.&quot;\</p>
<p>&quot;You should really be called Hui Ch'i, (latent fragrance), that would be proper; and why such stuff as Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance)?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How many sisters have you got?&quot; he further went on to ask of her.</p>
<p>&quot;Four,&quot; replied Hui Hsiang.</p>
<p>&quot;Which of them are you?&quot; Pao-yü asked.</p>
<p>&quot;The fourth,&quot; answered Hui Hsiang.</p>
<p>&quot;By and by you must be called Ssu Erh, (fourth child),&quot; Pao-yü suggested, &quot;for there's no need for any such nonsense as Hui Hsiang (orchid fragrance) or Lan Ch'i (epidendrum perfume.) Which single girl deserves to be compared to all these flowers, without profaning pretty names and fine surnames!&quot;</p>
<p>As he uttered these words, he bade her give him some tea, which he drank; while Hsi Jen and She Yüeh, who were in the outer apartment, had been listening for a long time and laughing with compressed lips.</p>
<p>Pao-yü did not, on this day, so much as put his foot outside the door of his room, but sat all alone sad and dejected, simply taking up his books, in order to dispel his melancholy fit, or diverting himself with his writing materials; while he did not even avail himself of the services of any of the family servants, but simply bade Ssu Erh answer his calls.</p>
<p>This Ssu Erh was, who would have thought it, a girl gifted with matchless artfulness, and perceiving that Pao-yü had requisitioned her services, she speedily began to devise extreme ways and means to inveigle him. When evening came, and dinner was over, Pao-yü's eyes were scorching hot and his ears burning from the effects of two cups of wine that he had taken. Had it been in past days, he would have now had Hsi Jen and her companions with him, and with all their good cheer and laughter, he would have been enjoying himself. But here was he, on this occasion, dull and forlorn, a solitary being, gazing at the lamp with an absolute lack of pleasure. By and by he felt a certain wish to go after them, but dreading that if they carried their point, they would, in the future, come and tender advice still more immoderate, and that, were he to put on the airs of a superior to intimidate them, he would appear to be too deeply devoid of all feeling, he therefore, needless to say, thwarted the wish of his heart, and treated them just as if they were dead. And as anyway he was constrained also to live, alone though he was, he readily looked upon them, for the time being as departed, and did not worry his mind in the least on their account. On the contrary, he was able to feel happy and contented with his own society. Hence it was that bidding Ssu Erh trim the candles and brew the tea, he himself perused for a time the &quot;Nan Hua Ching,&quot; and upon reaching the precept: &quot;On thieves,&quot; given on some additional pages, the burden of which was: &quot;Therefore by exterminating intuitive wisdom, and by discarding knowledge, highway robbers will cease to exist, and by taking off the jade and by putting away the pearls, pilferers will not spring to existence; by burning the slips and by breaking up the seals, by smashing the measures, and snapping the scales, the result will be that the people will not wrangle; by abrogating, to the utmost degree, wise rules under the heavens, the people will, at length, be able to take part in deliberation. By putting to confusion the musical scale, and destroying fifes and lutes, by deafening the ears of the blind Kuang, then, at last, will the human race in the world constrain his sense of hearing. By extinguishing literary compositions, by dispersing the five colours and by sticking the eyes of Li Chu, then, at length, mankind under the whole sky, will restrain the perception of his eyes. By destroying and eliminating the hooks and lines, by discarding the compasses and squares, and by amputating Kung Chui's fingers, the human race will ultimately succeed in constraining his ingenuity,&quot;&mdash;his high spirits, on perusal of this passage, were so exultant that taking advantage of the exuberance caused by the wine, he picked up his pen, for he could not repress himself, and continued the text in this wise: &quot;By burning the flower, (Hua-Hsi Jen) and dispersing the musk, (She Yüeh), the consequence will be that the inmates of the inner chambers will, eventually, keep advice to themselves. By obliterating Pao-ch'ai's supernatural beauty, by reducing to ashes Tai-yü's spiritual perception, and by destroying and extinguishing my affectionate preferences, the beautiful in the inner chambers as well as the plain will then, at length, be put on the same footing. And as they will keep advice to themselves, there will be no fear of any disagreement. By obliterating her supernatural beauty, I shall then have no incentive for any violent affection; by dissolving her spiritual perception, I will have no feelings with which to foster the memory of her talents. The hair-pin, jade, flower and musk (Pao-ch'ai, Tai-yü, Hsi Jen and She Yüeh) do each and all spread out their snares and dig mines, and thus succeed in inveigling and entrapping every one in the world.&quot;</p>
<p>At the conclusion of this annex, he flung the pen away, and lay himself down to sleep. His head had barely reached the pillow before he at once fell fast asleep, remaining the whole night long perfectly unconscious of everything straight up to the break of day, when upon waking and turning himself round, he, at a glance, caught sight of no one else than Hsi Jen, sleeping in her clothes over the coverlet.</p>
<p>Pao-yü had already banished from his mind every thought of what had transpired the previous day, so that forthwith giving Hsi Jen a push: &quot;Get up!&quot; he said, &quot;and be careful where you sleep, as you may catch cold.&quot;</p>
<p>The fact is that Hsi Jen was aware that he was, without regard to day or night, ever up to mischief with his female cousins; but presuming that if she earnestly called him to account, he would not mend his ways, she had, for this reason, had recourse to tender language to exhort him, in the hope that, in a short while, he would come round again to his better self. But against all her expectations Pao-yü had, after the lapse of a whole day and night, not changed the least in his manner, and as she really was in her heart quite at a loss what to do, she failed to find throughout the whole night any proper sleep. But when on this day, she unexpectedly perceived Pao-yü in this mood, she flattered herself that he had made up his mind to effect a change, and readily thought it best not to notice him. Pao-yü, seeing that she made no reply, forthwith stretched out his hand and undid her jacket; but he had just unclasped the button, when his arm was pushed away by Hsi Jen, who again made it fast herself.</p>
<p>Pao-yü was so much at his wit's ends that he had no alternative but to take her hand and smilingly ask: &quot;What's the matter with you, after all, that I've had to ask you something time after time?&quot;</p>
<p>Hsi Jen opened her eyes wide. &quot;There's nothing really the matter with me!&quot; she observed; &quot;but as you're awake, you surely had better be going over into the opposite room to comb your hair and wash; for if you dilly-dally any longer, you won't be in time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Where shall I go over to?&quot; Pao-yü inquired.</p>
<p>Hsi Jen gave a sarcastic grin. &quot;Do you ask me?&quot; she rejoined; &quot;do I know? you're at perfect liberty to go over wherever you like; from this day forth you and I must part company so as to avoid fighting like cocks or brawling like geese, to the amusement of third parties. Indeed, when you get surfeited on that side, you come over to this, where there are, after all, such girls as Fours and Fives (Ssu Erh and Wu Erh) to dance attendance upon you. But such kind of things as ourselves uselessly defile fine names and fine surnames.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you still remember this to-day!&quot; Pao-yü asked with a smirk.</p>
<p>&quot;Hundred years hence I shall still bear it in mind,&quot; Hsi Jen protested; &quot;I'm not like you, who treat my words as so much wind blowing by the side of your ears, that what I've said at night, you've forgotten early in the morning.&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü perceiving what a seductive though angry air pervaded her face found it difficult to repress his feelings, and speedily taking up, from the side of the pillow, a hair-pin made of jade, he dashed it down breaking it into two exclaiming: &quot;If I again don't listen to your words, may I fare like this hair-pin.&quot;</p>
<p>Hsi Jen immediately picked up the hair-pin, as she remarked: &quot;What's up with you at this early hour of the morning? Whether you listen or not is of no consequence; and is it worth while that you should behave as you do?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How can you know,&quot; Pao-yü answered, &quot;the anguish in my heart!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you also know what anguish means?&quot; Hsi Jen observed laughing; &quot;if you do, then you can judge what the state of my heart is! But be quick and get up, and wash your face and be off!&quot;</p>
<p>As she spoke, they both got out of bed and performed their toilette; but after Pao-yü had gone to the drawing rooms, and at a moment least expected by any one, Tai-yü walked into his apartment. Noticing that Pao-yü was not in, she was fumbling with the books on the table and examining them, when, as luck would have it, she turned up the Chuang Tzu of the previous day. Upon perusing the passage tagged on by Pao-yü, she could not help feeling both incensed and amused. Nor could she restrain herself from taking up the pen and appending a stanza to this effect:</p>
<p>  Who is that man, who of his pen, without good rhyme, made use,<br>
  A toilsome task to do into the Chuang-tzu text to steal,<br>
  Who for the knowledge he doth lack no sense of shame doth feel,<br>
  But language vile and foul employs third parties to abuse?\</p>
<p>At the conclusion of what she had to write, she too came into the drawing room; but after paying her respects to dowager lady Chia, she walked over to madame Wang's quarters.</p>
<p>Contrary to everybody's expectations, lady Feng's daughter, Ta Chieh Erh, had fallen ill, and a great fuss was just going on as the doctor had been sent for to diagnose her ailment.</p>
<p>&quot;My congratulations to you, ladies,&quot; the doctor explained; &quot;this young lady has fever, as she has small-pox; indeed it's no other complaint!&quot;</p>
<p>As soon as madame Wang and lady Feng heard the tidings, they lost no time in sending round to ascertain whether she was getting on all right or not, and the doctor replied: &quot;The symptoms are, it is true, serious, but favourable; but though after all importing no danger, it's necessary to get ready the silkworms and pigs' tails.&quot;</p>
<p>When lady Feng received this report, she, there and then, hastened to make the necessary preparations, and while she had the rooms swept and oblations offered to the goddess of small-pox, she, at the same time, transmitted orders to her household to avoid viands fried or roasted in fat, or other such heating things; and also bade P'ing Erh get ready the bedding and clothes for Chia Lien in a separate room, and taking pieces of deep red cotton material, she distributed them to the nurses, waiting-maids and all the servants, who were in close attendance, to cut out clothes for themselves. And having had likewise some apartments outside swept clean, she detained two doctors to alternately deliberate on the treatment, feel the pulse and administer the medicines; and for twelve days, they were not at liberty to return to their homes; while Chia Lien had no help but to move his quarters temporarily into the outer library, and lady Feng and P'ing Erh remained both in daily attendance upon madame Wang in her devotions to the goddess.</p>
<p>Chia Lien, now that he was separated from lady Feng, soon felt disposed to look round for a flame. He had only slept alone for a couple of nights, but these nights had been so intensely intolerable that he had no option than to choose, for the time being, from among the young pages, those who were of handsome appearance, and bring them over to relieve his monotony. In the Jung Kuo mansion, there was, it happened, a cook, a most useless, good-for-nothing drunkard, whose name was To Kuan, in whom people recognised an infirm and a useless husband so that they all dubbed him with the name of To Hun Ch'ung, the stupid worm To. As the wife given to him in marriage by his father and mother was this year just twenty, and possessed further several traits of beauty, and was also naturally of a flighty and frivolous disposition, she had an extreme penchant for violent flirtations. But To Hun-ch'ung, on the other hand, did not concern himself (with her deportment), and as long as he had wine, meat and money he paid no heed whatever to anything. And for this reason it was that all the men in the two mansions of Ning and Jung had been successful in their attentions; and as this woman was exceptionally fascinating and incomparably giddy, she was generally known by all by the name To Ku Ning (Miss To).</p>
<p>Chia Lien, now that he had his quarters outside, chafed under the pangs of irksome ennui, yet he too, in days gone by, had set his eyes upon this woman, and had for long, watered in the mouth with admiration; but as, inside, he feared his winsome wife, and outside, he dreaded his beloved lads, he had not made any advances. But this To Ku Niang had likewise a liking for Chia Lien, and was full of resentment at the absence of a favourable opportunity; but she had recently come to hear that Chia Lien had shifted his quarters into the outer library, and her wont was, even in the absence of any legitimate purpose, to go over three and four times to entice him on; but though Chia Lien was, in every respect, like a rat smitten with hunger, he could not dispense with holding consultation with the young friends who enjoyed his confidence; and as he struck a bargain with them for a large amount of money and silks, how could they ever not have come to terms (with him to speak on his behalf)? Besides, they were all old friends of this woman, so that, as soon as they conveyed the proposal, she willingly accepted it. When night came To Hun Ch'ung was lying on the couch in a state of drunkenness, and at the second watch, when every one was quiet, Chia Lien at once slipped in, and they had their assignation. As soon as he gazed upon her face, he lost control over his senses, and without even one word of ordinary greeting or commonplace remark, they forthwith, fervently indulged in a most endearing tête-à-tête.</p>
<p>This woman possessed, who could have thought it, a strange natural charm; for, as soon as any one of her lovers came within any close distance of her, he speedily could not but notice that her very tendons and bones mollified, paralysed-like from feeling, so that his was the sensation of basking in a soft bower of love. What is more, her demonstrative ways and free-and-easy talk put even those of a born coquette to shame, with the result that while Chia Lien, at this time, longed to become heart and soul one with her, the woman designedly indulged in immodest innuendoes.</p>
<p>&quot;Your daughter is at home,&quot; she insinuated in her recumbent position, &quot;ill with the small-pox, and prayers are being offered to the goddess; and your duty too should be to abstain from love affairs for a couple of days, but on the contrary, by flirting with me, you've contaminated yourself! but, you'd better be off at once from me here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're my goddess!&quot; gaspingly protested Chia Lien, as he gave way to demonstrativeness; &quot;what do I care about any other goddess!&quot;</p>
<p>The woman began to be still more indelicate in her manner, so that Chia Lien could not refrain himself from making a full exhibition of his warm sentiments. When their tête-à-tête had come to a close, they both went on again to vow by the mountains and swear by the seas, and though they found it difficult to part company and hard to tear themselves away, they, in due course, became, after this occasion, mutual sworn friends. But by a certain day the virus in Ta Chieh's system had become exhausted, and the spots subsided, and at the expiry of twelve days the goddess was removed, and the whole household offered sacrifices to heaven, worshipped the ancestors, paid their vows, burnt incense, exchanged congratulations, and distributed presents. And these formalities observed, Chia Lien once more moved back into his own bedroom and was reunited with lady Feng. The proverb is indeed true which says: &quot;That a new marriage is not equal to a long separation,&quot; for there ensued between them demonstrations of loving affection still more numerous than heretofore, to which we need not, of course, refer with any minuteness.</p>
<p>The next day, at an early hour, after lady Feng had gone into the upper rooms, P'ing Erh set to work to put in order the clothes and bedding, which had been brought from outside, when, contrary to her expectation, a tress of hair fell out from inside the pillow-case, as she was intent upon shaking it. P'ing Erh understood its import, and taking at once the hair, she concealed it in her sleeve, and there and then came over into the room on this side, where she produced the hair, and smirkingly asked Chia Lien, &quot;What's this?&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Lien, at the sight of it, lost no time in making a snatch with the idea of depriving her of it; and when P'ing Erh speedily endeavoured to run away, she was clutched by Chia Lien, who put her down on the stove-couch, and came up to take it from her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;You heartless fellow!&quot; P'ing Erh laughingly exclaimed, &quot;I conceal this, with every good purpose, from her knowledge, and come to ask you about it, and you, on the contrary, fly into a rage! But wait till she comes back, and I'll tell her, and we'll see what will happen.&quot;</p>
<p>At these words, Chia Lien hastily forced a smile. &quot;Dear girl!&quot; he entreated, &quot;give it to me, and I won't venture again to fly into a passion.&quot;</p>
<p>But hardly was this remark finished, when they heard the voice of lady<br>
Feng penetrate into the room. As soon as it reached the ear of Chia<br>
Lien, he was at a loss whether it was better to let her go or to snatch<br>
it away, and kept on shouting, &quot;My dear girl! don't let her know.&quot;\</p>
<p>P'ing Erh at once rose to her feet; but lady Feng had already entered the room; and she went on to bid P'ing Erh be quick and open a box and find a pattern for madame Wang. P'ing Erh expressed her obedience with alacrity; but while in search of it, lady Feng caught sight of Chia Lien; and suddenly remembering something, she hastened to ask P'ing Erh about it.</p>
<p>&quot;The other day,&quot; she observed, &quot;some things were taken out, and have you brought them all in or not?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have!&quot; P'ing Erh assented.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there anything short or not?&quot; lady Feng inquired.</p>
<p>&quot;I've carefully looked at them,&quot; P'ing Erh added, &quot;and haven't found even one single thing short.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Is there anything in excess?&quot; lady Feng went on to ascertain.</p>
<p>P'ing Erh laughed. &quot;It's enough,&quot; she rejoined, &quot;that there's nothing short; and how could there really turn out to be anything over and above?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That this half month,&quot; lady Feng continued still smiling, &quot;things have gone on immaculately it would be hard to vouch; for some intimate friend there may have been, who possibly has left something behind, in the shape of a ring, handkerchief or other such object, there's no saying for certain!&quot;</p>
<p>While these words were being spoken, Chia Lien's face turned perfectly sallow, and, as he stood behind lady Feng, he was intent upon gazing at P'ing Erh, making signs to her (that he was going) to cut her throat as a chicken is killed, (threatening her not to utter a sound) and entreating her to screen him; but P'ing Erh pretended not to notice him, and consequently observed smiling: &quot;How is it that my ideas should coincide with those of yours, my lady; and as I suspected that there may have been something of the kind, I carefully searched all over, but I didn't find even so much as the slightest thing wrong; and if you don't believe me, my lady, you can search for your own self.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You fool!&quot; lady Feng laughed, &quot;had he any things of the sort, would he be likely to let you and I discover them!&quot;</p>
<p>With these words still on her lips, she took the patterns and went her way; whereupon P'ing Erh pointed at her nose, and shook her head to and fro. &quot;In this matter,&quot; she smiled, &quot;how much you should be grateful to me!&quot; A remark which so delighted Chia Lien that his eyebrows distended, and his eyes smiled, and running over, he clasped her in his embrace, and called her promiscuously: &quot;My darling, my pet, my own treasure!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This,&quot; observed P'ing Erh, with the tress in her hand, &quot;will be my source of power, during all my lifetime! if you treat me kindly, then well and good! but if you behave unkindly, then we'll at once produce this thing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do put it away, please,&quot; Chia Lien entreated smirkingly, &quot;and don't, on an any account, let her know about it!&quot; and as he uttered these words, he noticed that she was off her guard, and, with a snatch, readily grabbed it adding laughingly: &quot;In your hands, it would be a source of woe, so that it's better that I should burn it, and have done with it!&quot; Saying this he simultaneously shoved it down the sides of his boot, while P'ing Erh shouted as she set her teeth close: &quot;You wicked man! you cross the river and then demolish the bridge! but do you imagine that I'll by and by again tell lies on your behalf!&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Lien perceiving how heart-stirring her seductive charms were, forthwith clasped her in his arms, and begged her to be his; but P'ing Erh snatched her hands out of his grasp and ran away out of the room; which so exasperated Chia Lien that as he bent his body, he exclaimed, full of indignation: &quot;What a dreadful niggardly young wench! she actually sets her mind to stir up people's affections with her wanton blandishments, and then, after all, she runs away!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If I be wanton, it's my own look-out;&quot; P'ing Erh answered, from outside the window, with a grin, &quot;and who told you to arouse your affections? Do you forsooth mean to imply that my wish is to become your tool? And did she come to know about it would she again ever forgive me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You needn't dread her!&quot; Chia Lien urged; &quot;wait till my monkey is up, and I'll take this jealous woman, and beat her to atoms; and she'll then know what stuff I'm made of. She watches me just as she would watch a thief! and she's only to hobnob with men, and I'm not to say a word to any girl! and if I do say aught to a girl, or get anywhere near one, she must at once give way to suspicion. But with no regard to younger brothers or nephews, to young and old, she prattles and giggles with them, and doesn't entertain any fear that I may be jealous; but henceforward I too won't allow her to set eyes upon any man.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If she be jealous, there's every reason,&quot; P'ing Erh answered, &quot;but for you to be jealous on her account isn't right. Her conduct is really straightforward, and her deportment upright, but your conduct is actuated by an evil heart, so much so that even I don't feel my heart at ease, not to say anything of her.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You two,&quot; continued Chia Lien, &quot;have a mouth full of malicious breath! Everything the couple of you do is invariably proper, while whatever I do is all from an evil heart! But some time or other I shall bring you both to your end with my own hands!&quot;</p>
<p>This sentence was scarcely at an end, when lady Feng walked into the court. &quot;If you're bent upon chatting,&quot; she urgently inquired, upon seeing P'ing Erh outside the window, &quot;why don't you go into the room? and what do you mean, instead, by running out, and speaking with the window between?&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Lien from inside took up the string of the conversation. &quot;You should ask her,&quot; he said. &quot;It would verily seem as if there were a tiger in the room to eat her up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There's not a single person in the room,&quot; P'ing Erh rejoined, &quot;and what shall I stay and do with him?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's just the proper thing that there should be no one else! Isn't it?&quot; lady Feng remarked grinning sarcastically.</p>
<p>&quot;Do these words allude to me?&quot; P'ing Erh hastily asked, as soon as she had heard what she said.</p>
<p>Lady Feng forthwith laughed. &quot;If they don't allude to you,&quot; she continued, &quot;to whom do they?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't press me to come out with some nice things!&quot; P'ing Erh insinuated, and, as she spoke, she did not even raise the portiere (for lady Feng to enter), but straightway betook herself to the opposite side.</p>
<p>Lady Feng lifted the portiere with her own hands, and walked into the room. &quot;That girl P'ing Erh,&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;has gone mad, and if this hussey does in real earnest wish to try and get the upper hand of me, it would be well for you to mind your skin.&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Lien listened to her, as he kept reclining on the couch. &quot;I never in the least knew,&quot; he ventured, clapping his hands and laughing, &quot;that P'ing Erh was so dreadful; and I must, after all, from henceforth look up to her with respect!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's all through your humouring her,&quot; lady Feng rejoined; &quot;so I'll simply settle scores with you and finish with it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ts'ui!&quot; ejaculated Chia Lien at these words, &quot;because you two can't agree, must you again make a scapegoat of me! Well then, I'll get out of the way of both of you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'll see where you'll go and hide,&quot; lady Feng observed.</p>
<p>&quot;I've got somewhere to go!&quot; Chia Lien added; and with these words, he was about to go, when lady Feng urged: &quot;Don't be off! I have something to tell you.&quot;</p>
<p>What it is, is not yet known, but, reader, listen to the account given in the next chapter.</p>

<p>  Upon hearing the text of the stanza, Pao-yü comprehends the Buddhistic<br>
      spells.<br>
  While the enigmas for the lanterns are being devised, Chia Cheng is<br>
      grieved by a prognostic.\</p>
<p>Chia Lien, for we must now prosecute our story, upon hearing lady Feng observe that she had something to consult about with him, felt constrained to halt and to inquire what it was about.</p>
<p>&quot;On the 21st,&quot; lady Feng explained, &quot;is cousin Hsüeh's birthday, and what do you, after all, purpose doing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do I know what to do?&quot; exclaimed Chia Lien; &quot;you have made, time and again, arrangements for ever so many birthdays of grown-up people, and do you, really, find yourself on this occasion without any resources?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Birthdays of grown-up people are subject to prescribed rules,&quot; lady Feng expostulated; &quot;but her present birthday is neither one of an adult nor that of an infant, and that's why I would like to deliberate with you!&quot;</p>
<p>Chia Lien upon hearing this remark, lowered his head and gave himself to protracted reflection. &quot;You're indeed grown dull!&quot; he cried; &quot;why you've a precedent ready at hand to suit your case! Cousin Lin's birthday affords a precedent, and what you did in former years for cousin Lin, you can in this instance likewise do for cousin Hsüeh, and it will be all right.&quot;</p>
<p>At these words lady Feng gave a sarcastic smile. &quot;Do you, pray, mean to insinuate,&quot; she added, &quot;that I'm not aware of even this! I too had previously come, after some thought, to this conclusion; but old lady Chia explained, in my hearing yesterday, that having made inquiries about all their ages and their birthdays, she learnt that cousin Hsüeh would this year be fifteen, and that though this was not the birthday, which made her of age, she could anyhow well be regarded as being on the dawn of the year, in which she would gather up her hair, so that our dowager lady enjoined that her anniversary should, as a matter of course, be celebrated, unlike that of cousin Lin.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, in that case,&quot; Chia Lien suggested, &quot;you had better make a few additions to what was done for cousin Lin!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's what I too am thinking of,&quot; lady Feng replied, &quot;and that's why I'm asking your views; for were I, on my own hook, to add anything you would again feel hurt for my not have explained things to you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That will do, that will do!&quot; Chia Lien rejoined laughing, &quot;none of these sham attentions for me! So long as you don't pry into my doings it will be enough; and will I go so far as to bear you a grudge?&quot;</p>
<p>With these words still in his mouth, he forthwith went off. But leaving him alone we shall now return to Shih Hsiang-yün. After a stay of a couple of days, her intention was to go back, but dowager lady Chia said: &quot;Wait until after you have seen the theatrical performance, when you can return home.&quot;</p>
<p>At this proposal, Shih Hsiang-yün felt constrained to remain, but she, at the same time, despatched a servant to her home to fetch two pieces of needlework, which she had in former days worked with her own hands, for a birthday present for Pao-ch'ai.</p>
<p>Contrary to all expectations old lady Chia had, since the arrival of Pao-ch'ai, taken quite a fancy to her, for her sedateness and good nature, and as this happened to be the first birthday which she was about to celebrate (in the family) she herself readily contributed twenty taels which, after sending for lady Feng, she handed over to her, to make arrangements for a banquet and performance.</p>
<p>&quot;A venerable senior like yourself,&quot; lady Feng thereupon smiled and ventured, with a view to enhancing her good cheer, &quot;is at liberty to celebrate the birthday of a child in any way agreeable to you, without any one presuming to raise any objection; but what's the use again of giving a banquet? But since it be your good pleasure and your purpose to have it celebrated with éclat, you could, needless to say, your own self have spent several taels from the private funds in that old treasury of yours! But you now produce those twenty taels, spoiled by damp and mould, to play the hostess with, with the view indeed of compelling us to supply what's wanted! But hadn't you really been able to contribute any more, no one would have a word to say; but the gold and silver, round as well as flat, have with their heavy weight pressed down the bottom of the box! and your sole object is to harass us and to extort from us. But raise your eyes and look about you; who isn't your venerable ladyship's son and daughter? and is it likely, pray, that in the future there will only be cousin Pao-yü to carry you, our old lady, on his head, up the Wu T'ai Shan? You may keep all these things for him alone! but though we mayn't at present, deserve that anything should be spent upon us, you shouldn't go so far as to place us in any perplexities (by compelling us to subscribe). And is this now enough for wines, and enough for the theatricals?&quot;</p>
<p>As she bandied these words, every one in the whole room burst out laughing, and even dowager lady Chia broke out in laughter while she observed: &quot;Do you listen to that mouth? I myself am looked upon as having the gift of the gab, but why is it that I can't talk in such a wise as to put down this monkey? Your mother-in-law herself doesn't dare to be so overbearing in her speech; and here you are jabber, jabber with me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My mother-in-law,&quot; explained lady Feng, &quot;is also as fond of Pao-yü as you are, so much so that I haven't anywhere I could go and give vent to my grievances; and instead of (showing me some regard) you say that I'm overbearing in my speech!&quot;</p>
<p>With these words, she again enticed dowager lady Chia to laugh for a while. The old lady continued in the highest of spirits, and, when evening came, and they all appeared in her presence to pay their obeisance, her ladyship made it a point, while the whole company of ladies and young ladies were engaged in chatting, to ascertain of Pao-ch'ai what play she liked to hear, and what things she fancied to eat.</p>
<p>Pao-ch'ai was well aware that dowager lady Chia, well up in years though she was, delighted in sensational performances, and was partial to sweet and tender viands, so that she readily deferred, in every respect, to those things, which were to the taste of her ladyship, and enumerated a whole number of them, which made the old lady become the more exuberant. And the next day, she was the first to send over clothes, nicknacks and such presents, while madame Wang and lady Feng, Tai-yü and the other girls, as well as the whole number of inmates had all presents for her, regulated by their degree of relationship, to which we need not allude in detail.</p>
<p>When the 21st arrived, a stage of an ordinary kind, small but yet handy, was improvised in dowager lady Chia's inner court, and a troupe of young actors, who had newly made their début, was retained for the nonce, among whom were both those who could sing tunes, slow as well as fast. In the drawing rooms of the old lady were then laid out several tables for a family banquet and entertainment, at which there was not a single outside guest; and with the exception of Mrs. Hsüeh, Shih Hsiang-yün, and Pao-ch'ai, who were visitors, the rest were all inmates of her household.</p>
<p>On this day, Pao-yü failed, at any early hour, to see anything of Lin Tai-yü, and coming at once to her rooms in search of her, he discovered her reclining on the stove-couch. &quot;Get up,&quot; Pao-yü pressed her with a smile, &quot;and come and have breakfast, for the plays will commence shortly; but whichever plays you would like to listen to, do tell me so that I may be able to choose them.&quot;</p>
<p>Tai-yü smiled sarcastically. &quot;In that case,&quot; she rejoined, &quot;you had better specially engage a troupe and select those I like sung for my benefit; for on this occasion you can't be so impertinent as to make use of their expense to ask me what I like!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's there impossible about this?&quot; Pao-yü answered smiling; &quot;well, to-morrow I'll readily do as you wish, and ask them too to make use of what is yours and mine.&quot;</p>
<p>As he passed this remark, he pulled her up, and taking her hand in his own, they walked out of the room and came and had breakfast. When the time arrived to make a selection of the plays, dowager lady Chia of her own motion first asked Pao-ch'ai to mark off those she liked; and though for a time Pao-ch'ai declined, yielding the choice to others, she had no alternative but to decide, fixing upon a play called, &quot;the Record of the Western Tour,&quot; a play of which the old lady was herself very fond. Next in order, she bade lady Feng choose, and lady Feng, had, after all, in spite of madame Wang ranking before her in precedence, to consider old lady Chia's request, and not to presume to show obstinacy by any disobedience. But as she knew well enough that her ladyship had a penchant for what was exciting, and that she was still more partial to jests, jokes, epigrams, and buffoonery, she therefore hastened to precede (madame Wang) and to choose a play, which was in fact no other than &quot;Liu Erh pawns his clothes.&quot;</p>
<p>Dowager lady Chia was, of course, still more elated. And after this she speedily went on to ask Tai-yü to choose. Tai-yü likewise concedingly yielded her turn in favour of madame Wang and the other seniors, to make their selections before her, but the old lady expostulated. &quot;To-day,&quot; she said, &quot;is primarily an occasion, on which I've brought all of you here for your special recreation; and we had better look after our own selves and not heed them! For have I, do you imagine, gone to the trouble of having a performance and laying a feast for their special benefit? they're already reaping benefit enough by being in here, listening to the plays and partaking of the banquet, when they have no right to either; and are they to be pressed further to make a choice of plays?&quot;</p>
<p>At these words, the whole company had a hearty laugh; after which, Tai-yü, at length, marked off a play; next in order following Pao-yü, Shih Hsiang-yün, Ying-ch'un, T'an Ch'un, Hsi Ch'un, widow Li Wan, and the rest, each and all of whom made a choice of plays, which were sung in the costumes necessary for each. When the time came to take their places at the banquet, dowager lady Chia bade Pao-ch'ai make another selection, and Pao-ch'ai cast her choice upon the play: &quot;Lu Chih-shen, in a fit of drunkenness stirs up a disturbance up the Wu T'ai mountain;&quot; whereupon Pao-yü interposed, with the remark: &quot;All you fancy is to choose plays of this kind;&quot; to which Pao-ch'ai rejoined, &quot;You've listened to plays all these years to no avail! How could you know the beauties of this play? the stage effect is grand, but what is still better are the apt and elegant passages in it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I've always had a dread of such sensational plays as these!&quot; Pao-yü retorted.</p>
<p>&quot;If you call this play sensational,&quot; Pao-ch'ai smilingly expostulated, &quot;well then you may fitly be looked upon as being no connoisseur of plays. But come over and I'll tell you. This play constitutes one of a set of books, entitled the 'Pei Tien Peng Ch'un,' which, as far as harmony, musical rests and closes, and tune go, is, it goes without saying, perfect; but there's among the elegant compositions a ballad entitled: 'the Parasitic Plant,' written in a most excellent style; but how could you know anything about it?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü, upon hearing her speak of such points of beauty, hastily drew near to her. &quot;My dear cousin,&quot; he entreated, &quot;recite it and let me hear it!&quot; Whereupon Pao-ch'ai went on as follows:</p>
<p>  My manly tears I will not wipe away,<br>
  But from this place, the scholar's home, I'll stray.<br>
  The bonze for mercy I shall thank; under the lotus altar shave my<br>
      pate;<br>
  With Yüan to be the luck I lack; soon in a twinkle we shall separate,<br>
  And needy and forlorn I'll come and go, with none to care about my<br>
      fate.<br>
  Thither shall I a suppliant be for a fog wrapper and rain hat; my<br>
      warrant I shall roll,<br>
  And listless with straw shoes and broken bowl, wherever to convert my<br>
      fate may be, I'll stroll.\</p>
<p>As soon as Pao-yü had listened to her recital, he was so full of enthusiasm, that, clapping his knees with his hands, and shaking his head, he gave vent to incessant praise; after which he went on to extol Pao-ch'ai, saying: &quot;There's no book that you don't know.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Be quiet, and listen to the play,&quot; Lin Tai-yü urged; &quot;they haven't yet sung about the mountain gate, and you already pretend to be mad!&quot;</p>
<p>At these words, Hsiang-yün also laughed. But, in due course, the whole party watched the performance until evening, when they broke up. Dowager lady Chia was so very much taken with the young actor, who played the role of a lady, as well as with the one who acted the buffoon, that she gave orders that they should be brought in; and, as she looked at them closely, she felt so much the more interest in them, that she went on to inquire what their ages were. And when the would-be lady (replied) that he was just eleven, while the would-be buffoon (explained) that he was just nine, the whole company gave vent for a time to expressions of sympathy with their lot; while dowager lady Chia bade servants bring a fresh supply of meats and fruits for both of them, and also gave them, besides their wages, two tiaos as a present.</p>
<p>&quot;This lad,&quot; lady Feng observed smiling, &quot;is when dressed up (as a girl), a living likeness of a certain person; did you notice it just now?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-ch'ai was also aware of the fact, but she simply nodded her head assentingly and did not say who it was. Pao-yü likewise expressed his assent by shaking his head, but he too did not presume to speak out. Shih Hsiang-yün, however, readily took up the conversation. &quot;He resembles,&quot; she interposed, &quot;cousin Lin's face!&quot; When this remark reached Pao-yü's ear, he hastened to cast an angry scowl at Hsiang-yün, and to make her a sign; while the whole party, upon hearing what had been said, indulged in careful and minute scrutiny of (the lad); and as they all began to laugh: &quot;The resemblance is indeed striking!&quot; they exclaimed.</p>
<p>After a while, they parted; and when evening came Hsiang-yün directed<br>
Ts'ui Lü to pack up her clothes.\</p>
<p>&quot;What's the hurry?&quot; Ts'ui Lü asked. &quot;There will be ample time to pack up, on the day on which we go!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We'll go to-morrow,&quot; Hsiang-yün rejoined; &quot;for what's the use of remaining here any longer&mdash;to look at people's mouths and faces?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü, at these words, lost no time in pressing forward.</p>
<p>&quot;My dear cousin,&quot; he urged; &quot;you're wrong in bearing me a grudge! My cousin Lin is a girl so very touchy, that though every one else distinctly knew (of the resemblance), they wouldn't speak out; and all because they were afraid that she would get angry; but unexpectedly out you came with it, at a moment when off your guard; and how ever couldn't she but feel hurt? and it's because I was in dread that you would give offence to people that I then winked at you; and now here you are angry with me; but isn't that being ungrateful to me? Had it been any one else, would I have cared whether she had given offence to even ten; that would have been none of my business!&quot;</p>
<p>Hsiang-yün waved her hand: &quot;Don't,&quot; she added, &quot;come and tell me these flowery words and this specious talk, for I really can't come up to your cousin Lin. If others poke fun at her, they all do so with impunity, while if I say anything, I at once incur blame. The fact is I shouldn't have spoken of her, undeserving as I am; and as she's the daughter of a master, while I'm a slave, a mere servant girl, I've heaped insult upon her!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And yet,&quot; pleaded Pao-yü, full of perplexity, &quot;I had done it for your sake; and through this, I've come in for reproach. But if it were with an evil heart I did so, may I at once become ashes, and be trampled upon by ten thousands of people!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;In this felicitous firstmonth,&quot; Hsiang-yün remonstrated, &quot;you shouldn't talk so much reckless nonsense! All these worthless despicable oaths, disjointed words, and corrupt language, go and tell for the benefit of those mean sort of people, who in everything take pleasure in irritating others, and who keep you under their thumb! But mind don't drive me to spit contemptuously at you.&quot;</p>
<p>As she gave utterance to these words, she betook herself in the inner room of dowager lady Chia's suite of apartments, where she lay down in high dudgeon, and, as Pao-yü was so heavy at heart, he could not help coming again in search of Tai-yü; but strange to say, as soon as he put his foot inside the doorway, he was speedily hustled out of it by Tai-yü, who shut the door in his face.</p>
<p>Pao-yü was once more unable to fathom her motives, and as he stood outside the window, he kept on calling out: &quot;My dear cousin,&quot; in a low tone of voice; but Tai-yü paid not the slightest notice to him so that Pao-yü became so melancholy that he drooped his head, and was plunged in silence. And though Hsi Jen had, at an early hour, come to know the circumstances, she could not very well at this juncture tender any advice.</p>
<p>Pao-yü remained standing in such a vacant mood that Tai-yü imagined that he had gone back; but when she came to open the door she caught sight of Pao-yü still waiting in there; and as Tai-yü did not feel justified to again close the door, Pao-yü consequently followed her in.</p>
<p>&quot;Every thing has,&quot; he observed, &quot;a why and a wherefore; which, when spoken out, don't even give people pain; but you will rush into a rage, and all without any rhyme! but to what really does it owe its rise?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's well enough, after all, for you to ask me,&quot; Tai-yü rejoined with an indifferent smile, &quot;but I myself don't know why! But am I here to afford you people amusement that you will compare me to an actress, and make the whole lot have a laugh at me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I never did liken you to anything,&quot; Pao-yü protested, &quot;neither did I ever laugh at you! and why then will you get angry with me?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Was it necessary that you should have done so much as made the comparison,&quot; Tai-yü urged, &quot;and was there any need of even any laughter from you? why, though you mayn't have likened me to anything, or had a laugh at my expense, you were, yea more dreadful than those who did compare me (to a singing girl) and ridiculed me!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü could not find anything with which to refute the argument he had just heard, and Tai-yü went on to say. &quot;This offence can, anyhow, be condoned; but, what is more, why did you also wink at Yün Erh? What was this idea which you had resolved in your mind? wasn't it perhaps that if she played with me, she would be demeaning herself, and making herself cheap? She's the daughter of a duke or a marquis, and we forsooth the mean progeny of a poor plebeian family; so that, had she diverted herself with me, wouldn't she have exposed herself to being depreciated, had I, perchance, said anything in retaliation? This was your idea wasn't it? But though your purpose was, to be sure, honest enough, that girl wouldn't, however, receive any favours from you, but got angry with you just as much as I did; and though she made me also a tool to do you a good turn, she, on the contrary, asserts that I'm mean by nature and take pleasure in irritating people in everything! and you again were afraid lest she should have hurt my feelings, but, had I had a row with her, what would that have been to you? and had she given me any offence, what concern would that too have been of yours?&quot;</p>
<p>When Pao-yü heard these words, he at once became alive to the fact that she too had lent an ear to the private conversation he had had a short while back with Hsiang-yün: &quot;All because of my, fears,&quot; he carefully mused within himself, &quot;lest these two should have a misunderstanding, I was induced to come between them, and act as a mediator; but I myself have, contrary to my hopes, incurred blame and abuse on both sides! This just accords with what I read the other day in the Nan Hua Ching. 'The ingenious toil, the wise are full of care; the good-for-nothing seek for nothing, they feed on vegetables, and roam where they list; they wander purposeless like a boat not made fast!' 'The mountain trees,' the text goes on to say, 'lead to their own devastation; the spring (conduces) to its own plunder; and so on.&quot; And the more he therefore indulged in reflection, the more depressed he felt. &quot;Now there are only these few girls,&quot; he proceeded to ponder minutely, &quot;and yet, I'm unable to treat them in such a way as to promote perfect harmony; and what will I forsooth do by and by (when there will be more to deal with)!&quot;</p>
<p>When he had reached this point in his cogitations, (he decided) that it was really of no avail to agree with her, so that turning round, he was making his way all alone into his apartments; but Lin Tai-yü, upon noticing that he had left her side, readily concluded that reflection had marred his spirits and that he had so thoroughly lost his temper as to be going without even giving vent to a single word, and she could not restrain herself from feeling inwardly more and more irritated. &quot;After you've gone this time,&quot; she hastily exclaimed, &quot;don't come again, even for a whole lifetime; and I won't have you either so much as speak to me!&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü paid no heed to her, but came back to his rooms, and laying himself down on his bed, he kept on muttering in a state of chagrin; and though Hsi Jen knew full well the reasons of his dejection, she found it difficult to summon up courage to say anything to him at the moment, and she had no alternative but to try and distract him by means of irrelevant matters. &quot;The theatricals which you've seen to-day,&quot; she consequently observed smiling, &quot;will again lead to performances for several days, and Miss Pao-ch'ai will, I'm sure, give a return feast.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whether she gives a return feast or not,&quot; Pao-yü rejoined with an apathetic smirk, &quot;is no concern of mine!&quot;</p>
<p>When Hsi Jen perceived the tone, so unlike that of other days, with which these words were pronounced: &quot;What's this that you're saying?&quot; she therefore remarked as she gave another smile. &quot;In this pleasant and propitious first moon, when all the ladies and young ladies are in high glee, how is it that you're again in a mood of this sort?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whether the ladies and my cousins be in high spirits or not,&quot; Pao-yü replied forcing a grin, &quot;is also perfectly immaterial to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They are all,&quot; Hsi Jen added, smilingly, &quot;pleasant and agreeable, and were you also a little pleasant and agreeable, wouldn't it conduce to the enjoyment of the whole company?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What about the whole company, and they and I?&quot; Pao-yü urged. &quot;They all have their mutual friendships; while I, poor fellow, all forlorn, have none to care a rap for me.&quot;</p>
<p>His remarks had reached this clause, when inadvertently the tears trickled down; and Hsi Jen realising the state of mind he was in, did not venture to say anything further. But as soon as Pao-yü had reflected minutely over the sense and import of this sentence, he could not refrain from bursting forth into a loud fit of crying, and, turning himself round, he stood up, and, drawing near the table, he took up the pencil, and eagerly composed these enigmatical lines:</p>
<p>  If thou wert me to test, and I were thee to test,<br>
  Our hearts were we to test, and our minds to test,<br>
  When naught more there remains for us to test<br>
  That will yea very well be called a test,<br>
  And when there's naught to put, we could say, to the test,<br>
  We will a place set up on which our feet to rest.\</p>
<p>After he had finished writing, he again gave way to fears that though he himself could unfold their meaning, others, who came to peruse these lines, would not be able to fathom them, and he also went on consequently to indite another stanza, in imitation of the &quot;Parasitic Plant,&quot; which he inscribed at the close of the enigma; and when he had read it over a second time, he felt his heart so free of all concern that forthwith he got into his bed, and went to sleep.</p>
<p>But, who would have thought it, Tai-yü, upon seeing Pao-yü take his departure in such an abrupt manner, designedly made use of the excuse that she was bent upon finding Hsi Jen, to come round and see what he was up to.</p>
<p>&quot;He's gone to sleep long ago!&quot; Hsi Jen replied.</p>
<p>At these words, Tai-yü felt inclined to betake herself back at once; but Hsi Jen smiled and said: &quot;Please stop, miss. Here's a slip of paper, and see what there is on it!&quot; and speedily taking what Pao-yü had written a short while back, she handed it over to Tai-yü to examine. Tai-yü, on perusal, discovered that Pao-yü had composed it, at the spur of the moment, when under the influence of resentment; and she could not help thinking it both a matter of ridicule as well as of regret; but she hastily explained to Hsi Jen: &quot;This is written for fun, and there's nothing of any consequence in it!&quot; and having concluded this remark, she readily took it along with her to her room, where she conned it over in company with Hsiang-yün; handing it also the next day to Pao-ch'ai to peruse. The burden of what Pao-ch'ai read was:</p>
<p>  In what was no concern of mine, I should to thee have paid no heed,<br>
  For while I humour this, that one to please I don't succeed!<br>
  Act as thy wish may be! go, come whene'er thou list; 'tis naught to<br>
      me.<br>
  Sorrow or joy, without limit or bound, to indulge thou art free!<br>
  What is this hazy notion about relatives distant or close?<br>
  For what purpose have I for all these days racked my heart with woes?<br>
  Even at this time when I look back and think, my mind no pleasure<br>
      knows.\</p>
<p>After having finished its perusal, she went on to glance at the Buddhistic stanza, and smiling: &quot;This being,&quot; she soliloquised; &quot;has awakened to a sense of perception; and all through my fault, for it's that ballad of mine yesterday which has incited this! But the subtle devices in all these rationalistic books have a most easy tendency to unsettle the natural disposition, and if to-morrow he does actually get up, and talk a lot of insane trash, won't his having fostered this idea owe its origin to that ballad of mine; and shan't I have become the prime of all guilty people?&quot;</p>
<p>Saying this, she promptly tore the paper, and, delivering the pieces to the servant girls, she bade them go at once and burn them.</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn't have torn it!&quot; Tai-yü remonstrated laughingly. &quot;But wait and I'll ask him about it! so come along all of you, and I vouch I'll make him abandon that idiotic frame of mind and that depraved language.&quot;</p>
<p>The three of them crossed over, in point of fact, into Pao-yü's room, and Tai-yü was the first to smile and observe. &quot;Pao-yü, may I ask you something? What is most valuable is a precious thing; and what is most firm is jade, but what value do you possess and what firmness is innate in you?&quot;</p>
<p>But as Pao-yü could not, say anything by way of reply, two of them remarked sneeringly: &quot;With all this doltish bluntness of his will he after all absorb himself in abstraction?&quot; While Hsiang-yün also clapped her hands and laughed, &quot;Cousin Pao has been discomfited.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The latter part of that apothegm of yours,&quot; Tai-yü continued, &quot;says:</p>
<p>&quot;We would then find some place on which our feet to rest.</p>
<p>&quot;Which is certainly good; but in my view, its excellence is not as yet complete! and I should still tag on two lines at its close;&quot; as she proceeded to recite:</p>
<p> &quot;If we do not set up some place on which our feet to rest,<br>
  For peace and freedom then it will be best.&quot;\</p>
<p>&quot;There should, in very truth, be this adjunct to make it thoroughly explicit!&quot; Pao-ch'ai added. &quot;In days of yore, the sixth founder of the Southern sect, Hui Neng, came, when he went first in search of his patron, in the Shao Chou district; and upon hearing that the fifth founder, Hung Jen, was at Huang Mei, he readily entered his service in the capacity of Buddhist cook; and when the fifth founder, prompted by a wish to select a Buddhistic successor, bade his neophytes and all the bonzes to each compose an enigmatical stanza, the one who occupied the upper seat, Shen Hsiu, recited:</p>
<p> &quot;A P'u T'i tree the body is, the heart so like a stand of mirror<br>
      bright,<br>
  On which must needs, by constant careful rubbing, not be left dust to<br>
      alight!\</p>
<p>&quot;And Hui Neng, who was at this time in the cook-house pounding rice, overheard this enigma. 'Excellent, it is excellent,' he ventured, 'but as far as completeness goes it isn't complete;' and having bethought himself of an apothegm: 'The P'u T'i, (an expression for Buddha or intelligence),' he proceeded, 'is really no tree; and the resplendent mirror, (Buddhistic term for heart), is likewise no stand; and as, in fact, they do not constitute any tangible objects, how could they be contaminated by particles of dust?' Whereupon the fifth founder at once took his robe and clap-dish and handed them to him. Well, the text now of this enigma presents too this identical idea, for the simple fact is that those lines full of subtleties of a short while back are not, as yet, perfected or brought to an issue, and do you forsooth readily give up the task in this manner?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He hasn't been able to make any reply,&quot; Tai-yü rejoined sneeringly, &quot;and must therefore be held to be discomfited; but were he even to make suitable answer now, there would be nothing out of the common about it! Anyhow, from this time forth you mustn't talk about Buddhistic spells, for what even we two know and are able to do, you don't as yet know and can't do; and do you go and concern yourself with abstraction?&quot;</p>
<p>Pao-yü had, in his own mind, been under the impression that he had attained perception, but when he was unawares and all of a sudden subjected to this question by Tai-yü, he soon found it beyond his power to give any ready answer. And when Pao-ch'ai furthermore came out with a religious disquisition, by way of illustration, and this on subjects, in all of which he had hitherto not seen them display any ability, he communed within himself: &quot;If with their knowledge, which is indeed in advance of that of mine, they haven't, as yet, attained perception, what need is there for me now to bring upon myself labour and vexation?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who has, pray,&quot; he hastily inquired smilingly, after arriving at the end of his reflections, &quot;indulged in Buddhistic mysteries? what I did amounts to nothing more than nonsensical trash, written, at the spur of the moment, and nothing else.&quot;</p>
<p>At the close of this remark all four came to be again on the same terms as of old; but suddenly a servant announced that the Empress (Yüan Ch'un) had despatched a messenger to bring over a lantern-conundrum with the directions that they should all go and guess it, and that after they had found it out, they should each also devise one and send it in. At these words, the four of them left the room with hasty step, and adjourned into dowager lady Chia's drawing room, where they discovered a young eunuch, holding a four-cornered, flat-topped lantern, of white gauze, which had been specially fabricated for lantern riddles. On the front side, there was already a conundrum, and the whole company were vying with each other in looking at it and making wild guesses; when the young eunuch went on to transmit his orders, saying: &quot;Young ladies, you should not speak out when you are guessing; but each one of you should secretly write down the solutions for me to wrap them up, and take them all in together to await her Majesty's personal inspection as to whether they be correct or not.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon listening to these words, Pao-ch'ai drew near, and perceived at a glance, that it consisted of a stanza of four lines, with seven characters in each; but though there was no novelty or remarkable feature about it, she felt constrained to outwardly give utterance to words of praise. &quot;It's hard to guess!&quot; she simply added, while she pretended to be plunged in thought, for the fact is that as soon as she had cast her eye upon it, she had at once solved it. Pao-yü, Tai-yü, Hsiang-yün, and T'an-ch'un, had all four also hit upon the answer, and each had secretly put it in writing; and Chia Huan, Chia Lan and the others were at the same time sent for, and every one of them set to work to exert the energies of his mind, and, when they arrived at a guess, they noted it down on paper; after which every individual member of the family made a choice of some object, and composed a riddle, which was transcribed in a large round hand, and affixed on the lantern. This done, the eunuch took his departure, and when evening drew near, he came out and delivered the commands of the imperial consort. &quot;The conundrum,&quot; he said, &quot;written by Her Highness, the other day, has been solved by every one, with the exception of Miss Secunda and master Tertius, who made a wrong guess. Those composed by you, young ladies, have likewise all been guessed; but Her Majesty does not know whether her solutions are right or not.&quot; While speaking, he again produced the riddles, which had been written by them, among which were those which had been solved, as well as those which had not been solved; and the eunuch, in like manner, took the presents, conferred by the imperial consort, and handed them over to those who had guessed right. To each person was assigned a bamboo vase, inscribed with verses, which had been manufactured for palace use, as well as articles of bamboo for tea; with the exception of Ying-ch'un and Chia Huan, who were the only two persons who did not receive any. But as Ying-ch'un looked upon the whole thing as a joke and a trifle, she did not trouble her mind on that score, but Chia Huan at once felt very disconsolate.</p>
