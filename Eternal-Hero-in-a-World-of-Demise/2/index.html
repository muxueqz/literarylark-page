    <h1>Part 1 Episode 1 Rampage Languang Chapter 2 Sister</h1>
    <p>Languang Seven Islands, located just a few dozen nautical miles from the largest continent of the Eastern Midland Plate, are inhabited by people of the Yanhuang ethnic group. They are a group of picturesque islands in the vast Heavenly Ocean, often referred to as the &ldquo;earrings of the Heavenly Ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Originally, these islands were known for producing a precious gemstone called &ldquo;blue light,&rdquo; and were referred to as &ldquo;Languang&rdquo; by ancient people. However, over the past thousand years, climate changes have turned these islands into a thriving habitat for various rare orchid species, leading to a change in their name to &ldquo;Languang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Languang Prefecture, named after the Languang Seven Islands, is also known as Languang. The nearby &ldquo;Mihong Mountain&rdquo; is considered one of the world&rsquo;s famous mountains, attracting visitors year-round and bringing significant revenue to Languang City.</p>
<p>On a global scale, the tourism industry of Languang Seven Islands ranks in the top ten. This exchange activity between Beitian University Affiliated Middle School and the Su Family Noble School has provided us, the financially challenged students, with a wonderful opportunity for a free trip.</p>
<p>Listening to the fresh voice of You Rong, the current top celebrity in Languang, the first jade beauty of the Eastern Five Continents, and known as the &ldquo;limitless future,&rdquo; I sat by the window in the aircraft cabin, stretching my body and enjoying the music. My friend, Huncha, sat beside me, and the students in front and behind us were making a lot of noise, occasionally disturbing my enjoyment of the music.</p>
<p>I pinched my glasses frame and looked at him coldly, warning, &ldquo;Call me again, and I&rsquo;ll eat you! Whoever dares to disturb my music time will have to deal with me! For a loyal fan like me, being interrupted at this moment is like having someone invade the most sacred chamber of my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huncha, who knows my preferences well, chuckled twice and immediately lowered his voice, showing a pleasing smile.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, this guy has been my best friend since childhood&hellip; I was extremely disappointed in my ability to choose friends.</p>
<p>Amidst the slight vibrations, the plane took off, and I sighed in contentment. As my feet touched the ground again, I hoped that all my troubles would disappear. Ignoring the still chattering Huncha, I turned up the volume of my earphones and immersed myself once more in the enchanting voice of You Rong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, hey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huncha, stop pushing&hellip;&rdquo; I mumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, hey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huncha, stop pushing&hellip;&rdquo; My voice was slightly louder this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, hey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huncha, you&rsquo;re so annoying. If you want to die&hellip; okay! I can arrange for you to disembark the plane!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I spoke with narrowed eyes, my voice gentle but with a hidden sharpness, and my fingers already on my glasses frame. I was just listening to &ldquo;Love Like Water,&rdquo; You Rong&rsquo;s song that I liked the most, and I had just immersed myself in its flowing melody. Did this guy really have to spoil the mood?</p>
<p>As long as he didn&rsquo;t apologize immediately, I had no doubt I would make his life miserable&hellip;</p>
<p>And then I saw a pair of clear, deep eyes, almost overflowing with watery brilliance, and, of course, the disapproving looks from everyone in the cabin.</p>
<p>Ah, what have I done?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Little sister, don&rsquo;t cry, don&rsquo;t cry, it&rsquo;s big brother&rsquo;s fault, I&rsquo;ll give you candy to eat, and you can listen to You Rong&rsquo;s songs&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I really wanted to find a hole to crawl into, or perhaps break a window and jump from ten thousand meters high – if it weren&rsquo;t for the terrified little girl tugging at my clothes.</p>
<p>At this moment, my face was burning hot, almost like a fried egg. In this situation, I had to comfort the teary-eyed little girl&hellip;</p>
<p>The little girl, now sipping the cold drink I reluctantly bought for her, had her beautiful face mostly hidden in the shadow of her white sunhat. However, she was smiling happily now, a far cry from her previous teary-eyed state. To achieve this remarkable transformation, I had spent a whopping thirty yuan—drinks on the plane were so expensive!</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel that I had seen the little girl&rsquo;s face somewhere before, but I couldn&rsquo;t recall where. I didn&rsquo;t dwell on it, as the most important thing at the moment was to comfort the child. Also, I needed to ask, where had that Lee Jiang, the guy who had casually thrown the hot potato at me, disappeared to?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The big brother who was sitting in the seat just now...&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl&rsquo;s face turned slightly redder and even more adorable. She lowered her head, no longer drinking the beverage, and had an apologetic expression, as if she had something difficult to say. I blinked, my mind raced through various possibilities, even to some less savory scenarios, but I still couldn&rsquo;t imagine what the situation with the guy was. It wasn&rsquo;t until I followed the little girl&rsquo;s gaze downward&hellip; the guy!</p>
<p>His head was round, drooling, shoe prints on his face, and he was in an abnormal state of slumber&hellip; Was he having a seizure?</p>
<p>&ldquo;This big brother just&hellip; so I&hellip; so he&rsquo;s now... I&rsquo;m sorry, it was my misunderstanding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl was still too shy, but I understood what had happened, thanks to the small bottle she still clutched, which had the label &ldquo;For dealing with perverts.&rdquo; And with a few stifled laughs from the classmates around us, I had a rough idea of what had transpired. Honestly, I was ashamed of you, Huncha!</p>
<p>Having understood the approximate sequence of events, I fulfilled my duty as a friend and pulled the guy out from under the seat, placing him in my original seat, against the window, and letting him sleep. Then, I focused on consoling the little girl.</p>
<p>Such an adorable little girl, how could I not comfort her properly? When no one was paying attention, my hand moved slightly around Huncha&rsquo;s waist. Well, let&rsquo;s consider it the cost of those two bottles of mineral water I treated him to that day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmm, crunch, it&rsquo;s so tasty! Nom nom&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking a bite of potato chips, a sip of cola, another bite of shrimp snacks, and another sip of cola&hellip; The junk food I usually scorned now tasted incredibly satisfying. I realized that the deliciousness of food is inversely proportional to how much you spend on it. The feeling of being carefree and burden-free was truly wonderful&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crunch&hellip; Do you like You Rong&rsquo;s songs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nom nom, yeah, I really like them, especially &lsquo;Love Like Water,&rsquo; nom nom&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahaha, you also like &lsquo;Love Like Water&rsquo;? But the song&rsquo;s reception wasn&rsquo;t the best!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Seeing the girl&rsquo;s suddenly bright eyes, I understood that I had encountered a fellow fan. I smiled knowingly and responded with an expert&rsquo;s answer, &ldquo;The music is not for everyone; it&rsquo;s a song filled with artistic expression and classical charm. It should be appreciated slowly and quietly! And the line &lsquo;Mountain streams splash on precious jade&rsquo; is a testament to You Rong&rsquo;s skill, truly a stroke of genius&hellip; Nom nom, by the way, don&rsquo;t address me like that, it&rsquo;s impolite. Call me big brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sun-hat girl said this with surprising enthusiasm.</p>
<p>And the next moment, her familiarity with You Rong left me almost rolling my eyeballs out of their sockets!</p>
<p>From this little girl&rsquo;s mouth, I learned countless pieces of information that could be classified as top-secret – from You Rong&rsquo;s birthday, zodiac sign, hobbies, clothing, makeup, eyebrow pencil, lipstick, to You Rong&rsquo;s favorite sandwich cookies, apple pie, and even the address of a certain shop on a certain street and lane in Languang that served big bowls of beef noodles&hellip;</p>
<p>She was a die-hard You Rong fan, with knowledge so meticulous that it left this semi-amateur fan of You Rong dumbfounded and humbled. I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder, though – hadn&rsquo;t the media stated that You Rong&rsquo;s personal information was tightly protected, and her manager, who also happened to be her aunt, the Miss Rong Zhiya nicknamed the &ldquo;Poppy Flower of the Entertainment Industry,&rdquo; mentioned that her information would only be disclosed when You Rong reached a certain legal age? How did this little girl know so much? Could it be&hellip; paparazzi?</p>
<p>I felt it was necessary to inquire more carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little sister&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Calling me &rsquo;little sister&rsquo; is big brother&rsquo;s responsibility, but calling me &rsquo;little sister&rsquo; is big brother&rsquo;s dereliction of duty. Big brother—&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl in the sunhat extended her crystal-clear finger and pointed at my nose, vetoing the name I had gotten used to, looking unhappy. As I gazed at her finger, radiating a faint glow, I couldn&rsquo;t help but want to take a bite. Her skin was really nice!</p>
<p>Of course, I understood this was a common mindset for kids of her age. I had been there, so I had to go along with it. &ldquo;Yes, yes, in that case, little sister&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haha, that sounds much better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl mercilessly cut off my question again, stretching her limbs on her seat, looking entirely at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big brother is still the best, very respectful. Seriously, I&rsquo;m already fifteen, not that young anymore&hellip; Oh yeah, big brother, do you happen to know about music? Nowadays, uh, fans rarely pay attention to classical-style songs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I chuckled softly. Did I know about music? I gently tapped her small nose and smiled, &ldquo;To be honest&hellip; your big brother here plays the flute so well that even the birds in the sky forget how to fly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wow, you&rsquo;re really shameless&hellip; I&rsquo;ve never heard someone talk like this in front of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but burst into laughter. &ldquo;Little sister, you&rsquo;re quite mature for your age. Between the two of us, who&rsquo;s really more shameless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little girl laughed too, her face blushing, making me want to take a big bite. At that moment, she whispered, &ldquo;Even if big brother isn&rsquo;t ashamed, I trust you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This child&hellip; my heart warmed, and I reached out to pat her cheek, smiling. &ldquo;Of course, you should trust me. Someday, I&rsquo;ll play just for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After boarding, Milen hadn&rsquo;t found a moment to relax. It took him half an hour to confirm the identity of the young man currently in the seat matched the information he had. When he received a positive reply, he had to take a deep breath to calm the trembling in his hands. As an outer member of a certain organization, he was sent on a mission that was honorable but easy, yet the consequences could be dire&hellip;</p>
<p>The plane was flying in the stratosphere, and there were only two minutes left until the planned action time. The target still hadn&rsquo;t shown any unexpected behavior; he was just chatting and laughing with a little girl, looking relaxed. It made Milen feel jealous to the point of almost dying.</p>
<p>Once again, he thought of his wife, far away on the other side of the ocean, and then his mind went blank. The countdown began!</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I sit here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A person with a heavy Eastern accent spoke to him in Jerulan, wearing a smile on their face, but the black eyes revealed tension no less than his own.</p>
<hr>
<p>Miran almost immediately thought of the worst-case scenario, and he instinctively pressed the button that had been soaked in his sweat for a long time&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boom!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some reason, the action movie playing on the large screen inside the cabin suddenly had its sound played out loud. This unexpected event seemed to shake the entire plane for a moment, even though it quickly returned to normal. However, the little girl was still startled, and I chuckled, but she retaliated by punching me in the chest with a small fist.</p>
<p>There was some commotion in the cabin at this moment, and the little girl and I turned our eyes in that direction. Well, it seems that times have changed, and the enthusiasm for Boy&rsquo;s Love can be displayed even now. Those two who were currently acting all lovey-dovey&hellip;</p>
<p>It seemed like they sensed someone&rsquo;s gaze, and those two suddenly turned their eyes towards my direction. That&rsquo;s when I noticed there was a foreigner sitting between them&hellip; Did it feel good to be caught in the crossfire of those two Boy&rsquo;s Love enthusiasts? I shivered instantly, pulling my little sister down to sit with me. The two of them exchanged glances and burst into laughter together.</p>
<p>Just as the girl was about to speak, the guy next to me suddenly didn&rsquo;t look so good. Thankfully, I acted quickly and delivered a sharp strike to his throat, preventing him from throwing up right here. Airsickness?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;Big brother, he might have had a bad reaction to that spray. If he vomits, he should be fine,&rdquo; my little sister explained from the side.</p>
<p>I see&hellip; serves him right! I chuckled, nodded to my little sister, and got up to help the guy to the restroom. My little sister watched me anxiously, and I patted her head, smiling. &ldquo;Wait here for a while, be good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You idiot! Even if you want to harm someone, you shouldn&rsquo;t drag down more than two hundred and seventy passengers here&hellip; Damn, who&rsquo;s the real terrorist in the end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The excessive shock made the Oriental man in the &ldquo;Boy&rsquo;s Love&rdquo; duo wish he could curse the man in front of him with every possible insult from his hometown. But now wasn&rsquo;t the time for venting. He glanced at the &ldquo;comrade&rdquo; who was already slumped in his seat and almost incapable of moving. After some consideration, he decided to activate his acupressure points before dealing with the intricate device in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had known it was such a messed-up mission, who would have come&hellip;&rdquo; he grumbled while his hands deftly disassembled the gadget, which was as compact as a wristwatch, before crushing it mercilessly. Meanwhile, the person he was willing to risk his life to protect was helping a &ldquo;travel sick&rdquo; individual pass by. There was a clear interest in the man&rsquo;s actions, but also an apparent psychological aversion due to the closeness.</p>
<p>I remembered to throw up the troublemaker in the restroom. After chatting with my little sister for a while, I realized I hadn&rsquo;t even asked for her name. I must be completely scatterbrained! Well, I&rsquo;d better find out when we get back and, if possible, ask for her contact address or phone number&hellip; The troublemaker stood there, still dazed, with his eyes closed. He chuckled and said, &ldquo;Little sister, come here, big brother has some candy for you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why did a similar phrase, whether uttered by me or him, sound different? No wonder my little sister had to use pepper spray! I sighed and used a bit of Qi to help him regain consciousness. At this moment, the flight attendant&rsquo;s announcement came on, signaling that the plane was preparing to land.</p>
<p>I rushed out immediately, and upon landing, everything was quite chaotic. But my little sister&hellip;</p>
<p>There was hardly any sensation of impact. The air hostess announced a safe landing, and at the same time, the head of our school&rsquo;s exchange program, &ldquo;Old Duck Spirit,&rdquo; wobbled his chubby body and began quacking with his hoarse duck-like voice, calling for everyone to assemble. All he ever did was call for assembly, but this time, I had absolutely no intention of responding, no matter how he used those beady little eyes to glare at me. Where was my little sister? Where had that little girl gone?</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t in her original seat, not even a shadow of her. I was sweating profusely, embarrassed to admit that I had sharp enough eyes at night to see mosquitoes mating from ten meters away, but now I couldn&rsquo;t find a trace of the sunhat girl. One-third of the passengers had already disembarked, and the cabin was becoming empty.</p>
<p>I scanned the cabin twice, and finally caught up with a classmate to ask, &ldquo;That little girl, her family came to pick her up, to the first-class cabin&hellip; She should have already disembarked by now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sighed. It was a pity. I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have the chance to see such a like-minded little sister again. I didn&rsquo;t even know her name&hellip;</p>
<p>Suddenly, my ears seemed to go quiet for a moment, then were filled with a deafening, ear-piercing roar. The volume was so loud that it could have been heard for miles, and it didn&rsquo;t seem to come from inside the cabin, yet it still made my ears hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yourong! Yourong!! Yourong!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was like a cataclysmic event, and this deafening cry overwhelmed me, making me dizzy. But that was just its secondary effect. The moment this sound came, the orderly flow of people in the cabin instantly turned into chaos!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yourong, it&rsquo;s Yourong!&rdquo; The girl&rsquo;s voice was always so piercing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yourong! Yourong!!&rdquo; The boy was always at a loss for words when he was excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yourong, Yourong, my Yourong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&hellip;Well, narcissistic words would definitely earn you a beating!</p>
<p>The previously arrogant Old Duck Spirit was tragically knocked down by the excited fans, and even the students who usually greeted him respectfully with &ldquo;Teacher&rdquo; couldn&rsquo;t help him up. They could only cry out helplessly, &ldquo;Ah, ah, this is bad, I can&rsquo;t control my feet&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sharp screams echoed in my ears, and a faint smile tugged at my lips.</p>
<p>Languang was Yourong&rsquo;s hometown, but I never imagined that I could get so close to her once I came here. Had Yourong appeared at the airport? I was&hellip; very lucky! But it was enough to watch from afar. I didn&rsquo;t have the energy to compete for a spot with hundreds and thousands of people.</p>
<p>Descending the gangway, I looked at the surging crowd in the waiting hall and took a deep breath. It was terrifying! Uh, was the Su family&rsquo;s welcoming party still alive?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Zhenyu, we meet again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The target safely arrived in Languang!</p>
<p>Mission successful (mission failed)!</p>
<p>As the plane safely touched down at Gate 6, two messages with similar content but vastly different in nature were immediately sent through two different channels to the people who needed this information in the shortest time possible. Unfortunately, both sides of the operation showed an indifferent attitude toward this information. It seemed that they didn&rsquo;t care at all about the near-death escape of over two hundred and seventy passengers on board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&hellip; it&rsquo;s good that it failed. If it didn&rsquo;t fail, that would have been really bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fede smiled, puffing on his beloved &ldquo;pirate&rdquo; edition cigar, and gestured to his personal secretary Nate.</p>
<p>Nate, who had been with me for over a decade, quickly sent out the information.</p>
<p>From this moment on, the grand plan that had been revised countless times and brewing for nearly five years was officially launched!</p>
<p>At the same time, at least seven or eight people in Languang wiped off cold sweat simultaneously and sighed in relief. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really a life-or-death situation. Even for a small probe, they made such a big move. Is the cost of taboo so high that it can&rsquo;t be exhausted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After sighing like this, the person in charge immediately issued a strict order. &ldquo;Damn it, we must never let that kid fly again in the future. It&rsquo;s neither in heaven nor on earth, and it makes us feel uneasy&hellip; Fortunately, that little girl is fine, but&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>How could we end up in such a situation? Do we have a karmic relationship with the Zhang family?</p>
<p>Even amidst the chaos and uproar of Yourong&rsquo;s fans going wild at this moment, her voice was still like a clear, sweet spring water, flowing gently and nourishing the heart. I turned around abruptly—Su Yi!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Su Yi! Uh, I mean, Su Yi, my classmate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compared to the previous time, this time&rsquo;s address was much smoother. I didn&rsquo;t blush this time and made some progress.</p>
<p>Su Yi was wearing a well-tailored school uniform dress, primarily in silver-blue with red trim, a color that was quite pleasing to the eye. The hem of her skirt was five centimeters above her knees, revealing her snow-white, beautifully curved legs, making her look exquisite.</p>
<p>It was a kind of exquisite pleasure. The belated blush finally appeared on her face. I averted my gaze and asked a nonsense question, &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you in the airport lounge&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was that place still habitable now? As soon as I spoke, I knew I was in trouble. Before I could think of a way to remedy the situation, the voice of the Old Duck Spirit came from behind. Su Yi gave me a smile with a hint of apology and turned to deal with the old man. I finally breathed a sigh of relief and took this opportunity to adjust my own mentality. In a few breaths, I finally got rid of the blush on my face.</p>
<p>Sitting in the bus that came to pick us up, I began to admire Su Yi&rsquo;s extraordinary charm. My classmates, a group that was very likely to turn into &ldquo;aspiring star-chasers&rdquo; just like the fans at the airport, were now bowing to her, entering the bus in an orderly manner, and leaving the airport&hellip; truly amazing!</p>
<p>I sat in the back, watching Su Yi, who was smiling and dealing with the Old Duck Spirit in front of her, feeling quite emotional.</p>
<p>Su&rsquo;s, Su&rsquo;s&hellip; what is Su&rsquo;s like? Very large&hellip; Can you be more specific?</p>
<p>I guess no one could describe it. After circling the school, there were a few places that left a deep impression on me—a large circular swimming pool surrounding the teaching building.</p>
<p>The open-air puB on the teaching building.</p>
<p>The standard 18-hole golf course that occupied almost one-third of the school&rsquo;s area&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hooligan next to me groaned, and I thought, probably everyone shared his sentiment—even a person like me.</p>
<p>The only one with a different opinion seemed to be the Old Duck Spirit. His face was as pale as if he had lost all his belongings—no wonder, sending these elite students to this place, was it equivalent to sending sheep into a tiger&rsquo;s den?</p>
<p>Next, with the help of many school receptionists, the allocation of accommodation for exchange students began. This was a very important part of the exchange program between the two schools, where students would live in a new environment, develop relationships with new schoolmates, and exchange cultures. It was the most humanistic aspect of this activity!</p>
<p>Yes, the most humanistic&hellip; Watching the smiling faces of classmates who would be spending a year together in the same school, it felt really good.</p>
<p>One by one, the students were assigned, and it was soon my turn. The receptionist was really busy, typing data into the computer while handing me a copy, all the while greeting me with a smile without even looking up. &ldquo;Zhang Zhenyu&hellip; Student, your name is quite masculine. You will be staying at the house of our student council president, so make sure to learn from her&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Student? For a moment, I was at a loss whether to laugh or cry. I looked at the copy, and in the gender column, it was clearly marked as male!</p>
<p>I felt it was necessary to remind him, &ldquo;Uh, senior, have you noticed the gender column on my form&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at me, and his pupils suddenly dilated in that moment. Then he lowered his head to look at the gender column on my form. &ldquo;Male&hellip; Male!&rdquo; His voice trembled as he spoke.</p>
<p>As he frantically typed on the computer, Su Yi walked over. Before I could say anything, the senior stood up and said to Su Yi, &ldquo;President, there&rsquo;s an error in this document&hellip; this freshman&rsquo;s place of residence has somehow been changed to your home, and&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Error? No mistake at all. Zhang Zhenyu is supposed to stay at my house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Yi took the copy from the stunned senior, looked at it, and confirmed once again, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s correct. I personally entered the data, and there&rsquo;s absolutely no problem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, Su Yi, um, Su Yi, I wanted to ask why you want me to stay at your house. I noticed that the other students are&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled happily and answered calmly, &ldquo;My father wants to meet you. He said you are the son of his old friend, like a half-son to him. Since you&rsquo;ve come to Languang, it&rsquo;s only right for our family to extend hospitality. So, it&rsquo;s only natural for you to stay at our house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I see! I scratched my head, I made things too complicated&hellip; However, I heard that this unfamiliar Uncle Su has a very successful business, and in such circumstances, he could still think of my situation so thoughtfully. I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel grateful. &ldquo;Is Uncle Su at home now? I should thank him in person&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, unfortunately, he went out for business negotiations a couple of days ago&hellip; If you want to meet him, it&rsquo;ll have to be at least a month from now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was stunned. Did that mean&hellip; we would be the only two at home?</p>
<p>Through the gap in the curtains, I could see the faint light in the eastern sky. I sat up in bed and jumped out of bed with a light landing, making no noise. This was a guest room on the second floor of the Su mansion. When I arrived at the Su mansion in person, I realized how unnecessary my worries and inexplicable expectations were.</p>
<p>The Su mansion, located on the top of Languang&rsquo;s first-ranking mountain, Mi Xiangshan, was a luxurious residence in an upscale residential area. Rather than calling it a mansion, it was more like a castle. It had excellent natural lighting, and even taking a few steps inside was very comfortable. I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder how my rogue of a father had the chance to know such a successful entrepreneur?</p>
<p>Although the master of the house was not at home now, there were still more than a dozen servants and bodyguards in the mansion, making it quite lively. Naturally, there would be no awkward situation of &ldquo;a man and a woman alone in a room&rdquo; — Su Yi&rsquo;s residence was on the third floor, and it would take a minute to walk there.</p>
<p>Taking a breath of fresh morning air and moving my joints slightly, there was a &ldquo;crackling&rdquo; sound, and I changed into sportswear and headed outside. Yesterday, Su Yi invited me to do morning exercises and go shopping in the city, and I naturally couldn&rsquo;t refuse. I also had to take this opportunity to fulfill the task my old man had given me&hellip;</p>
<p>Uh&hellip; it seemed that the morning exercises at the Su family were somewhat different. In the spacious courtyard in front of the main house, there was a not-so-small martial arts hall, which was the place for morning exercises. Pushing open the door, the shouts and yells inside were like thunder&hellip; Well, the soundproofing was quite good.</p>
<p>Su Yi hadn&rsquo;t arrived yet, and I stood at the door somewhat shyly, wanting to enter but not daring to enter, watching the bodyguards inside shouting and practicing martial arts. Until someone inside noticed my arrival.</p>
<p>It was Kim Woo, whom I had met before. He was drenched in sweat and waved at me with great enthusiasm, smiling and inviting me to come over and practice. I widened my eyes&hellip; that was a no-go. Did you still want to live?</p>
<p>I shook my head vigorously, but he took it as a sign of stage fright and came over, smiling, and pulled me, who was already red-faced, toward the corner where the exercise equipment was. &ldquo;You can use that, Master Zhang. We dare not spar with you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being called &ldquo;Master&rdquo; made me very uncomfortable all over. I chuckled dryly a couple of times, and only then did I realize that I didn&rsquo;t even know where to put my hands and feet now... Maybe letting my body move a bit was a good choice.</p>
<p>Sitting on the rowing machine, I absentmindedly opened and closed it, using the body&rsquo;s movements to finally harmonize my mood. However, I still felt something was not quite right in my heart. I scanned the entire martial arts hall, and I noticed that the bodyguards were all staring at me in a daze. Why were they looking at me like that? I blinked a few times, continued moving my hands, and tried to say something, but the words never came out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Zhenyu, your physical fitness is really impressive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Su Yi, dressed in a martial arts uniform, entered the room. Her shiny black hair was elegantly tied into a high ponytail, and her clear, watery eyes scanned over in my direction, revealing a surprised expression. She walked over to me, and I stood up as if granted amnesty, offering her a smile.</p>
<p>She smiled back and lowered her gaze to the rowing machine I had just used, her eyes showing a keen interest. &ldquo;150 kilograms&hellip; Zhang Zhenyu, you must exercise regularly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah&hellip; ah, what else could I say! I adjusted my glasses and managed to force out a smile, but it didn&rsquo;t feel right&hellip;</p>
<p>Su Yi&rsquo;s face never displayed surprise for more than three seconds. She now wore that same calm and composed smile as before, but under that smile, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Zhenyu&hellip; classmate, do you really need to address me so formally now that you&rsquo;re staying at my house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uh, you mean&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle told me you&rsquo;re three months older than me. So, from now on, you can call me &lsquo;Xiao Yi&rsquo; or &lsquo;Xiao Su.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s more friendly that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She bent over and gave me a slight bow. Her long ponytail created a graceful arc in the air, captivating me.</p>
<p>My response this time was passable. I also bent down, a bit stammering but managing to convey my thoughts: &ldquo;Xiao Yi, from now on, please teach me a lot. Is it okay for me to call you that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave me a sweet smile.</p>
<p>Shopping, shopping, let&rsquo;s go shopping. I went shopping with Xiao Yi!</p>
<p>My soul felt light, and I hadn&rsquo;t settled down since changing the way I addressed her in the morning. Xiao Yi, Xiao Yi, Xiao Yi&hellip;</p>
<p>Maybe changing a form of address really could change one&rsquo;s mood. At this moment, I, for some reason, had an expectation that I hadn&rsquo;t dared to think of before&hellip; Maybe she was indeed different from others!</p>
<p>Vaguely, I seemed to remember that during breakfast this morning, Su Yi invited me to join the school&rsquo;s &ldquo;Kendo Club,&rdquo; and the reason she invited me was because she was the female captain of the club&hellip; I was deeply moved by this reason, and I hesitated for a moment before agreeing&hellip;</p>
<p>Now that I thought about it, I suddenly felt some regret. My main purpose for coming here was my academic pursuits, but how did I end up considering Japanese Kendo? Although my swordsmanship was not as good as that sword genius, Zhang Yanliu, I should still be better than the captain of some club&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;U-ge, come over and take a look. Do you like this color?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dressed casually but always so dazzling, Xiao Yi beckoned to me under the protection of the two big bodyguards, Kim Woo and Kim Joon. Her voice was like a gentle breeze drifting in the sky, piercing right into my heart. My body warmed up in an instant, and there was nothing left in my mind.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t going crazy or acting foolish or being infatuated. I thought I was just getting a cold after being hit by love&hellip; Perhaps, maybe, most likely, should I say&hellip; my love has arrived? I asked myself gently in my heart, and my face felt a bit hot again. Undoubtedly, I felt something special for Su Yi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo; I responded with a voice that startled even myself—I was too excited!</p>
<p>The Blue Jade Spring and Autumn Pavilion was one of the rare cultural landmarks in Languang. Inside, it housed a peculiar blue sapphire said to have been unearthed during the &ldquo;Era of Divine Destruction,&rdquo; known as the &ldquo;Languang Seven Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;mother stone&rdquo; of all gem deposits holds strong historical significance, and many ancient relics from the &ldquo;mythical era&rdquo; are preserved here.</p>
<p>As I looked at the massive plaque that read &ldquo;Time Never Rests&rdquo; at the entrance of the Spring and Autumn Pavilion, something jumped into my mind. It was something my father had instructed me to take care of as soon as I arrived in Languang&hellip; I furrowed my brow, and after breaking free from Su Yi&rsquo;s charm, I knew I had to step away for a moment.</p>
<p>I had arranged a meeting point, so I discreetly left Su Yi&rsquo;s side, found a relatively quiet spot, removed my glasses, and closed my eyes slowly. I carefully controlled the surging true energy within me.</p>
<p>True energy clearly emanated from my body, forming a faint yet distinct information flow that moved around me. Only then did I start walking, circling around the Spring and Autumn Pavilion until I got a response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thousand Peaks Compete in Beauty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One Line Dominates All!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It felt like a scene from a third-rate novel, and I responded to the code phrase with a mixture of amusement and bewilderment.</p>
<p>As soon as I answered, the person I had been waiting for all along appeared before me. He was a middle-aged man in casual clothing, and his gaze held a hint of surprise as he looked at me. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you Zhang Yunwang&hellip; Oh, you&rsquo;re Zhang&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zhang Zhenyu!&rdquo; I replied with a wry smile, and then I saw the realization dawn in his eyes.</p>
<p>Their information seemed to be quite well-informed. I put on my glasses, retracted my true energy, and quickly resumed the demeanor of an ordinary person. I asked him, &ldquo;My dad said I need to register with you when I arrive in Languang&hellip; Is that correct?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, then inexplicably asked, &ldquo;Have you been registered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Registered for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked perplexed, and he chuckled, shaking his head without explaining further. He smiled at me and said, &ldquo;Follow me; the procedures are quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Following him through a series of twists and turns, we arrived at a shop outside the memorial hall. Behind the shop, there was another world altogether. Despite the limited space, it was neatly organized, with books and ancient paintings displayed in an orderly fashion. I entered alone, and there was a person already waiting inside. He spoke as soon as I entered, &ldquo;SP level, intensity&hellip; your identity, choose one, fill it out on this form. Most people choose &lsquo;identity.&rsquo; Can you use a computer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed me a laptop, and it took me a while to remember what &ldquo;SP&rdquo; meant. My father had explained it to me before. &ldquo;SP&rdquo; was an abbreviation for the ancient Roba word &ldquo;supernatura1poer,&rdquo; which meant natural power.</p>
<p>It was a universal standard used worldwide for measuring individuals with extraordinary abilities, just like the Roba language itself, which had universal applicability worldwide.</p>
<p>When my father explained it to me, my interest was focused on the question of &ldquo;foreigners practicing martial arts,&rdquo; almost causing me to forget this basic term.</p>
<p>For someone like me, influenced by the Eastern martial arts system, the grading criteria for SP levels seemed vague and crude. It simply categorized individuals with supernatural powers into twelve levels based solely on their strength, with three levels making up one rank: Low Rank, Middle Rank, High Rank, and Special Rank. The classification appeared simple and easy to understand, but the actual differences in power were immense.</p>
<p>This is almost inconceivable in the Eastern martial arts system! Factors like aura, temperament, and strategy, the &ldquo;soft conditions,&rdquo; were not considered in this standard. However, this standard was established more than 3,800 years ago, and considering the complexity of human brains at that time, it&rsquo;s not surprising!</p>
<p>I never thought that I would need to use this grading standard here. My father had never mentioned what level I currently held. In reality, this registration for exceptional individuals from other regions was for the convenience of managing public order and handling various affairs for people like us&hellip; After some thought, I decided to fill in my identity, just a name, it shouldn&rsquo;t hurt.</p>
<p>The person looked at my name, widened his mouth in surprise, and then looked at me. &ldquo;So, you&rsquo;re Zhang Zhenyu. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to meet you. I&rsquo;m Han Zhongshan from &lsquo;Dao Hai Men.&rsquo; If you ever need anything, feel free to contact me; I&rsquo;m usually here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought for a moment and smiled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met Han Mingxin from your sect before. His water-walking skills are impressive!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Han Zhongshan smiled warmly and mentioned that Han Mingxin was his nephew and the top talent among the newcomers in the sect. He had achieved a good ranking in the recent East Sea Martial Arts Tournament.</p>
<p>After a brief conversation, I finally started filling out the form. Han Zhongshan&rsquo;s response was swift, and he smiled as he escorted me out. He left a positive impression, and at the very least, he had sharp insight!</p>
<p>My father&rsquo;s instructions were now complete, and I had nothing left to do. I needed to meet up with Su Yi, but&hellip;</p>
<p>As I stepped out of the shop, I suddenly couldn&rsquo;t tell which way was which. I walked a few steps along the crowded street in a daze, thinking I should be near the entrance of the Spring and Autumn Pavilion, but when I looked up, I was taken aback. &ldquo;Where&hellip; am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought your son would turn out to have no sense of direction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two middle-aged men, thousands of miles apart, simultaneously enjoyed the same amusing scene. The live video recording obtained through the use of high-precision military satellites amid their busy schedules was quite precious. So, one of them took the opportunity to tease his lifelong friend, while the other just smirked. &ldquo;Are you happy to have my directionally challenged son hanging around your perfect daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice trembled slightly, clearly less stable and smooth than the other person&rsquo;s end of the call. Zhang Yunwang appeared somewhat frustrated as he raised his voice a bit more, but doing so only intensified the artillery and bombing sounds on his side. Nevertheless, this allowed the two men, who had been at odds for a long time, to finally get to the point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the plane landed safely, the Forbidden has already dispatched forces here&hellip; It&rsquo;s very secretive, and that kind of power doesn&rsquo;t seem like it&rsquo;s just for attending a local conference, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that even better? Let my directionally challenged son join in the fun. This way, Su Lao&rsquo;er, you&rsquo;ll finally get your wish fulfilled&hellip; Just remember to pay my son a commission in the future!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a deal. If your directionally challenged son really has the guts to pursue my daughter, you&rsquo;ll also have to take good care of him in the future&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two mature and handsome men laughed coldly together, their laughter sending chills through each other&rsquo;s hearts&hellip;</p>
