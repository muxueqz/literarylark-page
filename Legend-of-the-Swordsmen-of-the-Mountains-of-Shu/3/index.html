    <h1>The second dance long sword master and apprentice in the hands of Emei smoke and rain lock up</h1>
    <p>The second dance long sword master and apprentice in the hands of Emei smoke and rain lock up  It is said that Li Ning&rsquo;s father and daughter and Zhou Chun farewell to the villagers and went to the mountains.</p>
<p>Except for Ying Qiong, he wanted to learn the sword earlier in Ying Qiong, and he was all unreasonable people.</p>
<p>He played the scenery along the way, walked slowly, and walked to the west of Emei until the day.</p>
<p>I saw the guest shop there, and there were many people in the mountains, and it looked very lively.</p>
<p>The three found a guest shop, prepared to buy some applications early, and went up the mountain to live for a long time.</p>
<p>Nothing overnight.</p>
<p>On the second day, the three of them discussed and settled: Li Ning took the role of buying household items, such as oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, rice, noodles, wine, meat, etc.; Zhou Chun took the role of buying books, pens and ink, and pots and pans, buckets, and other kitchen supplies, and then went to buy a few feet long a hemp rope. The first thing I did was to buy a hemp rope, which was several feet long.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Chun said: &ldquo;Stopping will know herself, it will be more useful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the three -person luggage is limited, there are many additional things. After a while, he hired his husband and picked up the mountain together. Fragrant guests on the road saw them, and they all felt strange. The three of him didn&rsquo;t care about him, and walked towards the mountain. At the beginning, although I walked a few stomachs, it was not very difficult to walk. Later, the more the mountain trail became more dangerous, the more the scenery became strange, and Baiyun flew around only from the head, and sometimes it was impossible to see people on the opposite side. Yingqiong shouted interesting. Zhou Chun said: &ldquo;There is no rain when you go to the mountain. Now there are so many clouds and fogs, and the mountains must be raining under the mountains. We must walk in the clouds and fog, so we must pay attention, otherwise, if you lose your feet, you will have to shatter your bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Essence Looking back at the mountain, I saw a piece of underworld, where can I see others; the temples of the mountain temple are hidden in the middle of the smoke. A red day on the head, shining on the clouds, reflects the light shine, and the evil is good -looking. Ying Qiong was seeing the gods, and saw the football husband: &ldquo;The guest officer has now reached the sheep, and then the past is ghosts and sorrow. It is no way to go. We can&rsquo;t move forward. Today, this cloud color must be Rain, we can&rsquo;t go down the mountain today. Tomorrow will delay our day&rsquo;s business. The guest official is more convenient. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Chun said:&rdquo; We originally hired you to come here, and you waited for a while. Go, how do I add some wine to you? &quot;</p>
<p>Saying, I jumped, and went to a towering goblin beside me, and then climbed up the hill from the cypress tree. Take out the hemp rope and drag the luggage one by one. Put down the hemp rope again and drag Yingqiong up. Just dragged into the middle, Ying Qiong looked at it, and saw that this was really dangerous. She was a desperate. She was dazzling and shaking her eyes although she was bold. After Ying Qiong went up, Li Ning took out one or two silver with his football husband to make money, and he still went up. The three discussed their luggage. Zhou Chun said: &ldquo;I have been here many times, and I am very familiar. I first lead your father and daughter to the hole. Let me pick it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Ning was not polite because of the Landsman. Each person took some light objects and passed a few cliffs. There were about three miles to reach the head of the cave door. I saw four large characters on the wall of the cave, which is &ldquo;Soseki Qiyun&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When the three entered the cave, I saw that the CCP had four stone rooms: three as the bedroom, and one of the light as a place for everyone to read. Zhou Chun took the application one by one and took three times to finish it. Packing up is already the sunset. Everyone ate some dry food and dried preserved, closed the hole with stones, and went to sleep.  In the early morning of the next day, Li Ning and Ying Qiong set up a course, taught her to practice qi and soul, and all kinds of internal skills. Ying Qiong was originally talented and unusual, and did not eliminate many days and moon, and had practiced all kinds of soft kung fu. Just because she was born with anxiety, she was troubled by Li and Tuesday to teach her swordsmanship. Seeing her rapidly, Zhou Chun also thought that it could be taught. Only Li Ning refused to say that he had not arrived. One day, Zhou Chun helped Yingqiong say love. Li Ning said: &ldquo;The virtuous brother only knows one, I don&rsquo;t know. I wonder if she can learn the sword now? You must know that the more talented people, the thicker the foundation. I have no enough to be her teacher, so I concentrate on it now and stabilize her foundation with her. Once you come, you can become a large teacher. Now if you are engaged in hasty Teaching with her can not be alone. In addition, her temperament is fierce, but she is not willing to convince people easily. There are many heroes like my generation in the world. Once I meet a strong enemy, dirty? Learning is already deep. Although it is not as extraordinary as Gu La&rsquo;s sword fairy, it is better to achieve the invincible world. I did n’t want to teach her at first, and I was smart for her. For the sake of reason. &quot;</p>
<p>When Zhou Chun heard this, it was inconvenient to persuade. However, Ying Qiong is as fast as fire, how to resist. Although the scenery on the mountain is good, it is just as bad as the same beauty, that is, far from the water source. Fortunately, there is a lot of ways from this hole. There is a waterfall on the half -mountain cliff, and there is a small stream below. The water is clear and the spring is sweet and clean. Every two days, Li and Tuesday are taken in turn to take water. Li and Tuesday, because they were afraid of dispersing their bones, they got up every day, and they must practice various sword -fisting techniques on the open space in front of the cave. Ying Qiong was reluctant to teach her, and she looked at it with her heart. When the two of him were not in front of him, he practiced himself. The ape monkey on Mount Emei was the most. Ying Qiong saw the monkey running on the cliff one day. It was as fast as flying, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but move her thoughts of practicing lightness. She gets up early every morning, and the two ropes brought by each end are tied to a tree, and she is practicing walking on her own. And forced Zhou and Li to teach her all kinds of light skills. She was born with great divine power, plus the guidance of these two teachers, not only practiced as light as a swallow, but also abnormal power.  Every month, Zhou Chun must visit Yan&rsquo;er once and teach him martial arts by the way. That day was about to go down the mountain to visit him. I just walked to the shore of the rock, and suddenly saw Zhao Yaner running, holding a letter in his hand. Zhou Chun opened it, and it turned out to be written by Ma Xiang. The letter said: &ldquo;A monk came three days ago. The shape was fierce and abnormal. He carried a iron wood fish on his body and weighed about three or four hundred pounds. He went to the village to Zhonghua. Just to find a friend named Zhou Zhou. The people in the village, because he looks fierce, is discussing with fate, and there is no abolishment of external behavior. He is because he has no surname Zhou in the village. Suddenly, a fast -moving village person talked about Mr. Zhou, and he asked Mr. Zhou&rsquo;s name. He listened and said, &quot;</p>
<p>It must be him, I can&rsquo;t think of the third child of the cloud in the clouds, but I still have him in this life in this life. On the day of meeting! &ldquo;When he said, his face was very ugly. He was asking where Mr. He was now, and I just walked out with Yan Er, and the person who quickly said, saying that asking Mr.&rsquo;s whereabouts, we must ask us. The monk came to ask me . I think he is not good at coming, and I told him that Mr. Zhou went to Chengdu and did not tell him to live in Emei. He is no longer in the village today, and he must go to Chengdu to find you. It&rsquo;s not good, so let&rsquo;s make a letter to you and prepare early. &quot;</p>
<p>When Zhou Chun was shocked, he said to Yan Er: &ldquo;You go up the mountain and talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said, he hurriedly carried Yan&rsquo;er, went up the dangerous cliff, and came to the cave. After Yan&rsquo;er met Li Ning&rsquo;s father and daughter, he said to Zhou Chun: &ldquo;I said because Teacher Ma said that the monk was not good. That night, I went to the founding of the monk to detect what kind of person he was. More timely, climbing on his roof, using the trend of pearl curtain roll hooks to see the room, I saw this meditation there. After sitting for a moment, he got up and took out the two people who had been dried from the iron fish fish. Finger, look and see, and then stretch out his right hand to compare and compare it. It turns out that there are only three fingers left on his right hand. Take out a small bag and take out a clay sculpture from the inside. The appearance is ashamed to the teacher, and it is also a white saber, but there are two wings on the back. The teeth were bite, as if hate, and patted the mud to cursing. I couldn&rsquo;t help but be furious and was waiting for him to ask him. What were he had an injustice with the teacher? To be reasonable, I hit him half to death. Whoever thought that I was thinking of getting off the room, it seemed that someone squeezed me back, and I couldn&rsquo;t make a voice, and suddenly felt that my body was in mid -air. The official temple was close to the left and surprised me. I was concealed from my mother. I was afraid that her old man would wake up and find me. I was ready to go back and take a look. I went home and took a look. My mother hadn&rsquo;t woke up yet. I saw a note on the table, which was written very well. The paper said: &quot;</p>
<p>Yan&rsquo;er is so bold, and the back mother is involved in the danger. The next morning will quickly go to Emei and send a letter to the teacher.&rdquo; I met this. Think about it: &quot;</p>
<p>I have a mother in the church, so I should not involve the danger. According to the tone of the person who stayed, the monk must be a leader, I am not an opponent. I was suddenly mentioned in the room in that room. It was also what this person did. &ldquo;After thinking all night, the mother told my mother the next day. My mother told me to send a letter to the teacher quickly. These days, I was examined the monthly lesson, and I was afraid that Mr. Ma would not be allowed to come. Who wanted me to study in the house, Before he opened his mouth, Teacher Ma called me at no one, ordered me to send a letter to the teacher, and gave me three money silver as a trading fee. I quickly moved. As soon as I walked out of the dozen miles, I saw two people in front of the quarrel. . I have a closer look, one is the monk, and the other is a Taoist, and I can&rsquo;t help but startled me. The joy is far away. They never noticed me, so I gave up the big road and turned from the hillside. Copy mountain road rushed. I wonder if the teacher knows the origin of this monk? &quot;</p>
<p>To know how Zhou Chun answered, and see the decomposition.</p>
