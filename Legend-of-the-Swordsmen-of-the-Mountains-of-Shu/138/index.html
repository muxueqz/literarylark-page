    <h1>Three -7 times Tian Jingshi Breaks the Dust Dust Electric Star Chi Shuangzhu Savior Savior</h1>
    <p>Three -7 times Tian Jingshi Breaks the Dust Dust Electric Star Chi Shuangzhu Savior Savior  When I got up the next morning, Fengzi saw that the two mountains were murmuring in Tibetan.</p>
<p>First, they thought they were just a fear of difficulties.</p>
<p>If they knew that they entered the wild mountain, they would leave.</p>
<p>Later, they saw their face with panic, and asked them what reason, refused to say that they were more suspicious.</p>
<p>When Fengzi knew the habits of the mountain people, he dialed out, drank, and raised the seven or eight bunches flat, and he hit a tall mountain stone beside the road.</p>
<p>Small half -cut, broken stones, and Mars splashed.</p>
<p>The two mountain people kneeling on the ground, shaking all over, and shouted that the little god was forgiving.</p>
<p>Fengzi drank: &ldquo;You just tell me, why are you panicked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mountain people were forced to be forced. They stirred around and whispered: &ldquo;Last night, I slept on the big tree outside the cave. God. I want to be because the old real and apprentices are not allowed to provide him for him, for the foreign gods, and want to take the time to get the Great God and the little god to eat and hate. I wanted to escape. Ridge, afraid that the black god will kill us; if you don&rsquo;t escape, you are afraid of walking on the road, and even the two of me eat together. Now the little god is forced to say, he can&rsquo;t eat the great god, and when the two of me go back Once. We are not afraid of death, but we are eaten by God. We ca n’t reincarnate. Anyway, think about it and save me. &quot;</p>
<p>Then, we cried like a ghost.  Feng Zi knows that what he said is the wolf noodle god. The mountain people are used to seeing the gods and ghosts, and saying that it is what is not common beasts and worms, and then asked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s both you see it. What shape? &quot;</p>
<p>The Ershan people replied again:&rdquo; Last night, the moonlight was very bright, and we were explaining that he could go back at noon. Suddenly, he saw the god who was about the same as the gods of the great god. When I came, I went straight into the cave. After a while, the two gods came out and stood on the ground to argue. Only then did we see that God was a face, and his hands were very long, not tall. A god, speaking, is similar to the Great God and Little God, only wearing tiger skin on the upper and lower body, and a golden retriever from head to back from head to back, shining straight, and a tiger skin around the waist. After a while, I shouted, and still walked away. As soon as I walked, there was another tall and big god from Nanshan, and I was even more afraid of people. Huang Guang, his face is a bit like monkeys, his eyes are red and green, and brighter than lightning. When you see the two gods in front of the front, they have not entered the hole. One for a while, there was no shadow. When I first started, a big tree was hindering his road. He was swept away by his long arms and became two stages. I changed to another plant. Fortunately, it was not on the tree, or I was dead last night. At that time, I was so scared and I dared not come out. The three gods must follow us, how dare to say? In this case, God must see the strange, so he has to live with the great god. &quot;</p>
<p>Because Fengzi was not familiar with the way, the mountain people expressed their unwillingness to send it beforehand, and they felt inconvenient. I don&rsquo;t want to do this, don&rsquo;t persuade, but volunteer to follow. He glanced at Yun Cong, secretly rejoicing, Fengzi knew that the mountain people were stupid and feared. What I saw last night must be a dream. If you do n’t say it, Yun has always been sleeping alert, and a little loud, he wakes up himself. How did n’t you realize last night, and that thing did n’t invade? And how can the two mountain people enter the dream at the same time, what is not bad? Perhaps what kind of beast, with the ability of yourself and Yun Cong, plus the frosty sword, there is nothing to worry about. Lohn&rsquo;s intimidation of the two articles: &ldquo;You two don&rsquo;t say, I already know. Last night, the god entered the cave, because we were beaten by our great gods, because we were sleeping, not chasing, and I didn&rsquo;t think of you. Wild Lingling, we didn&rsquo;t need to lead you, but that God had eaten our losses, and we couldn&rsquo;t keep your two of you. When I said to the great god, if you read you, you would be able to break up with Emei and break up. On the way, I wo n’t do Zhang Zhizhi like just now. Come to sleep in the evening. You are outside. If you see the movement, whether he is a person or a weird, just come in to report to the letter. Because of the eyes, the two saw that the two gods entered the cave for a while last night, Yun Cong and Fengzi were not injured. He heard that they believed that they were now happy and agreed. From because of the shape of the thing that the two said, the shape of that thing seemed to have seen it. Feng Zi and the two finished speaking, and invited the road, because there were two people reporting to the police. After all, they were a little wary. They held the sword and iron 镧 in their hands. Pay attention at any time and rush forward.  Without a long time, walk into a valley and enter the Wild Lingling. Seeing the mountain shape was sinister, the cliffs were standing on both sides, and towering towering. The long vine shrubs are mixed with Danfeng, red and green, and the shade is covered with the sun. On the red sandy land, Jing Zhen hindered the feet, and the diameter was narrow. This kind of way, mountain people are always used to walk. The cloud has never experienced, and it is still Fengzi opened the way forward. After walking far, I finished this narrow valley and crossed a small plain full of reckless plains, and went under the foothills of the wild mountain. This mountain is hundreds of miles, and Lin Fengcao is long, everywhere. It is necessary to cross this mountain to reach Emei, and a group of four walked to the mountain. There was no road in the deserted mountains, and the dangerous cliffs were cut, and there were some silkworms. Sometimes it goes to the extremely dangerous place, with a critical stone overwhelming, and the lower than the abyss, the foot is narrow and slippery, and it is even more hindered. When you walk, you need to put the back wall, the long vines on the wall, squatting with your head, holding your breath, calming your mind, looking for the road with your feet, changing your hands with both hands, and slowly moved forward. If you don&rsquo;t pay attention, grab it on the rotten wood and withered vine, and if you slide the feet, you will break the bones and fall into the abyss. Except for the wind, Hugh said, Yun Cong, even the people who were used to the mountain roads were a little bold. Sometimes I came to my head again, there was no way to pass, and then I climbed the vine on the tens of hundreds of feet of high cliffs. There were many snakes in the grass, and they were entangled accidentally. Fortunately, the four have weapons, and the parcels are not very large, and they are not hindered. This way, it turns high and short, and helps Fujin, and it is laborious. And it is so dangerous that the roads are not long.  After two hours of walking, I actually walked to the relatively flat Yamahara. Although in autumn, because of the concave ground in the mountains, the wind is blocked on all sides, and the plants are still abundant. The extremely low and humidity, because the landscape is stored, the long -term tide is moist, and the clusters are extraordinarily fat. On the top is a bunch of five -color clouds in the east, condensing, but mountains, and you have to walk around it. The two mountain people are as even more like a raccoon cat, walking all the way, and they can&rsquo;t stop looking at it. Yun Cong asked them why? The two said that Ben Mountain was used to the beasts and often became in groups. Walking like flying. When people are not eaten by them, they are also overwhelmed by them, and they are mud. And last night that God was even more powerful, so I was afraid. Yun from seeing the grass and trees so lush, there was no beast, and he didn&rsquo;t take it to heart. The four people talked and walked, and they didn&rsquo;t feel that they passed the basin again, crossed a ridge, and walked into a jungle. How fat is the wild grass thorns on the side of the mountain. In this forest, it is still a mixed mountainous mountain, but it is not born. The trees are all more than thousands of years of ancient trees, the most pine cypress, high -dry towering, dancing, a lot of color, very green onion cage. Fengzi accidentally saw the two broken trees, because the forest was dense, and did not fall to the ground. It was slanted on other trees. Three people come to see. When they saw it, they screamed, saying that there must be a pond in the woods. What a fierce and evil beast must come here to drink water. If you say it, you will be on the ground. Looking at it, he said with a sorrow: &quot;</p>
<p>At noon, the beasts are out of food for food. If you don&rsquo;t come here, you can get out of the forest. Because the pine and the pine is too prosperous, you can&rsquo;t smell the smell, but the ground has already been on the ground. Discover the beast. &quot;  Fengzi looked at what he pointed, and looked at it and looked at it from time to time. There were not obvious bowls of big hoof marks from time to time. Going forward, the more you go the hoof, the more trees are broken, and some karma is yellow. After walking another two miles, it really has a large pond in the center of the forest. It is about a few feet deep. The Qingquan is like thousands of pearls. , Gathering endlessly. On the three sides of the pond, there are two or three acres of wide open space. At the end of the ground, the woods are dense like row. Just one side leaning on a slope, although it is full of jungle, there is a gap of several feet wide. The beasts on the ground are messy, and the hoof prints are different, and their types are different, which is enough to prove that the mountain people are not bad. On the slope, it must be the way of the beast. But that Lin Zhao looked straight and had reached the end. Slowly, it is a person, and the black beast is hard to fly, and it is necessary to get around that slope. Knowing that there are thousands of beasts here, it is difficult to protect this way. It ’s okay to do it. If there are too many, it is not better than the killing of the mountain people. As soon as I came forward, I was unsatisfactory, and it was difficult to resist how much the ability. But there is no other way. When Fengzi and Yun discussed, when he remembered the ruthless fire, Zhang Sanzai came to pass the drunks, and he originally said that this trip was dangerous. He fulfilled some of them on the way. Relief to go around from that slope. Because I see radon all the way, I dare not drink with water. A group of four people were thirsty, and it was rare to have such a spring. Seeing the two mountains were drinking the cattle beside the pond, the two also took out the water scoop and drank a few sips, which was really sweet. Drink told the mountain people that they would go away from that slope. The two of them all had a lot of doubts all the way, and they were even more frightened. Answer: &quot;</p>
<p>This road, the two of me had been here twice. When I came back, I almost didn&rsquo;t be killed by the wild sister -in -law. At that time, I was walking, but I didn&rsquo;t see this pond. I wanted to take the road. After walking, walk here by mistake. If the road of Zhaoyanzi is going, it must be encountered, and it is stepped into meat. Only go back and find the original road, save your life. &quot;
Fengzi is so far away.</p>
<p>There is something before, the beast parade, and there is no accurate way.</p>
<p>If you go back, you know you wo n’t meet?</p>
<p>Then he repeatedly enlightened the two, saying that the great gods would have the magical law, and it was better to protect it.</p>
<p>If you really do n’t want to do it, he will listen to the two of him to go back.</p>
<p>When the two heard their words, they were even more scared, so they had to be doubtful.</p>
<p>Fengzi has gone wrong because the road has gone, and it is not necessary to have the guidance of the two.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the direction is not bad.</p>
<p>Ershan people are afraid of ghosts and gods, and they will never escape at this time.</p>
<p>Then he resolved the back of the back and handed over the Ershanmin.</p>
<p>On the road, the grass and trees had been flattened by the beast.</p>
<p>It would not be hindered to walk.</p>
<p>After a while, the slope was finished.</p>
<p>If it wasn&rsquo;t, a beast did not see it.</p>
<p>The two of them became more anxious, saying that like they were walking last time, if they could not see one at the time, more when they came.</p>
<p>Yun Cong and Fengzi ignored them.</p>
<p>They were still in front of Fengzi.</p>
<p>After walking for a while, I was suddenly in Lin Maocao, the beasts were gone, and there was no movement.</p>
<p>The four of them were hungry, they chose a place, took out food food, a full meal, and still moved forward.</p>
<p>In the direction of the Japanese color, the foot of the mountain gradually walked up the top of the mountain.</p>
<p>Essence Four Gu Yunyan is vast, and the mountains are submerged.</p>
<p>Shi talents only worked hard, and did not look back.</p>
<p>The clouds did not know when it would start.</p>
<p>Because of the height of the mountain, the mountains are still cold and clear.</p>
<p>The four of them resting slightly, seeing Nayun&rsquo;s balls and one place, piled up one place, and instantly became a Yunshan Mountain.</p>
<p>The sunlight is on the side of the clouds, and the back of the light is colorful, and Wu Wu did not retreat.</p>
<p>The mountains are high, you can&rsquo;t spend the night, and you don&rsquo;t take it down to rush down the mountain while you are looking for the road.</p>
<p>Anyway, the upper half of the mountain is not covered by the clouds, and it is a journey for a journey.</p>
<p>Where can I say where to go.</p>
<p>It is better to pass through the clouds, otherwise it is better to find a place in the mountainside, which is stronger than the wind.</p>
<p>Shang Yi stopped, and went down.</p>
<p>Gradually walking away from the clouds, although it has not yet arrived, there are already light clouds with a piece of light clouds and flew slowly.</p>
<p>Looking at the road ahead, it was just snow and white, and it was confused.</p>
<p>From top to bottom, the place where the scriptures are different from the mountain.</p>
<p>This side is obliquely width.</p>
<p>Except for random grass red sand, it is said that the cave is not even the forest.</p>
<p>Flying ant poison flies in the grass, small snake evil worms, everywhere, there is a proper place to live.</p>
<p>At this time, the cloud mist became more and more dense, and gradually surrounded people.</p>
<p>After a while, even the roads that went up were covered by the clouds, and people could not be seen across the opposite side.</p>
<p>I never saw the situation below the situation.</p>
<p>I was in a hurry, and I heard that there were thousands of giggies in the cloud below.</p>
<p>There were turbulences there.</p>
<p>When it was timely, the two mountains listened on the side of the ears, and they screamed violently.</p>
<p>Run.</p>
<p>Fengzi did not catch it, because in the cloud, he was afraid that he would lose from the clouds and did not dare to chase.</p>
<p>But it ’s all in the Ershan people.</p>
<p>What should I eat on the way?</p>
<p>At the same time, the voices of the commotion below became more and more real, and the two gradually smelled the beast.</p>
<p>Those two mountain people escaped so urgently, knowing that there are thousands of beasts in the clouds below.</p>
<p>When I came, I looked at the clouds, and I was separated by the clouds.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>Now he is in the cloud prisoner, and the dilemma is in dilemma.</p>
<p>Although people and beasts do not see each other opposite each other, they do not attack, but the beast nose smells the most spiritually.</p>
<p>In case of smelling the taste of life, rushing over from the clouds and fog, wouldn&rsquo;t they suffer more?</p>
<p>In contrast, there is no such cloud shielding, and you can escape.</p>
<p>Although the two have a skill, they are in this extremely dangerous situation, and they have nowhere to make it.</p>
<p>At this time, the clouds have unintentionally raised their hands, and the glasses on the sword are shining on the side.</p>
<p>Wind&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>After taking a picture of the sword, the two could distinguish their faces.</p>
<p>Fang wanted to tell Fengzi that he borrowed the sword light in front of him.</p>
<p>The words were right, and Fengzi whispered quietly, &ldquo;Brother is paying attention, and Yun is about to scatter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Yun Cong and Fengzi talked, Zheng Jian felt that his face could not be recognized without sword light. When I heard the words, the clouds on the soles of the feet gradually rose up. Only as thin as the light and fog is as thin as the fog, and some small groups are fine, as the breeze is rippling. Looking at the mountain in the shadow, I saw a piece of gray, and it was still not very clear. Looking up, it was covered by the clouds from the head, and the clouds were white, as if the sky was too low to press on the head. The company&rsquo;s white fluff can be touched by reaching out.  I just wanted to raise the sword in the clouds to take a picture. Try how far the sword light can shoot in the clouds. Shi Cai stood in the clouds for a while, and his clothes were wet by the clouds, and he was blown by this violent mountain breeze. He could not help but fight a cold war. Gang said with a saying, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listening to the beast below again, and then he listened to Fengzi and shocked. At this time, the floating clouds on the foot had been swept away by the mountain wind. It turned into thousands of marks and blowing smoke, scattered and flying away, floating in the air, and the gray black below seemed to flash there. It is not a geocentrus, but a kind of thousands of monsters gathered there, squeezed together, rarely move, or there may be a few Angle necks. It looks like a sulfur, with a triangle of the head, and the body is black like lacquer, and the black light is slippery. Black pressure was not seen, and I didn&rsquo;t know how much the number was. It covered the underwood under the mountain. From top to bottom, the terrain is inclined and there is no danger. The side of the mountain is much closer than the top to the bottom, and the place where you stand up with the group monsters is only two miles high, five or seven miles away. Fengzi knew that this kind of beast grew up, and he ran up. Although he and Yun Congjia will be martial arts, longer than the vertical jump, but he has no choice but to listen to the mountains that the killing can not be killed, and the running can&rsquo;t run, let alone fly over the top of thousands of wild beasts. In addition to not surprising them and letting them dissipate by themselves, don&rsquo;t think of it. The mountain shape is so clear that you can&rsquo;t find a place to hide. He had to pull the clouds with your hands, he was on the ground, and he would not see them in front of him, and then thought about his ideas.  The two only squatted down, and Yun heard the sound of not far from the front. In the past, I went to the deserted mountain by mistake, and Lu Yu Qunhu had experienced experience. Busy and Fengzi looked back. I do n’t know when, except a few feet, there are seven or eight beasts that are the same as below. The beast shape is really similar to the place name, the head looks like a horse, the top of the triangle, the body is not as long as the horse, but it is thicker than the horse. Guan was staring at a pair of tigers, destined to be a fierce evil. There is one of the largest in it. The industry has stood up and lowered his head and lowered down. Fengzi grew up as wild since childhood. When he knew that this beast was acting, he had to flutter, and just shouted, &ldquo;Big brother pays attention!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The biggest one had already lowered his head, a whine, and the four legs were supported. With a few feet high, he rushed straight in front of the two. When the big monster yelled, the rest of the number fell into a momentum, as the big one arrived at the same time. Yuncong and Fengzi were not afraid of these, and what they were afraid of was the large group in the basin below. Knowing that these big ones are the head of the beast group, they have been discovered by them, and they have roared, and there must be a group of monsters below. At this time, not only did it fail, but instead evoked the habits of the beast chasing people. The capture of the thief first captured the king. If you killed the next few, the big group may be shocked.  The two coincided with their minds, and they kept their blade and waited. Speaking of time, at that time, it was almost, and in this thought, the seven or eight monsters who were like non -elapse were not far from the two. Fengzi did not allow them to land, their legs were working hard, holding the iron pupae, first raised the air, and greeted the biggest to the biggest head. This monster&rsquo;s four feet are empty, and it will not fall to the ground and cannot turn around. The wind was greeted by Fengzi, struggling with the power, and a drink, a shot of the beast head, a sound of it. The strange beast had just opened, and the roar of the death of death did not roar. The brain was broken immediately, his back facing the sky, dancing around for a while, and falling to the ground. Fengzi borrowed a shock and was falling, and he was falling. I was shocked, and I was sparse. I didn&rsquo;t see the ground clearly. At this time, the two were on the face, and they were all fierce. If the wind was hit, it would hurt. At first sight, Fengzi was not good, and suddenly remembered the solution of the weak Liu Yaofeng in Emei swordsmanship and winning the three losses. Raise the handle, protect the front brain door, cross -feet cross, and the heels are strong. Turned the crossed feet. A golden dragon rolled, and his body was biased towards the side to avoid the positive momentum. Then go up and hold your right hand, bend your right hand, and hit the beast head. This copper is beating on the left corner of the beast, breaking immediately. Fengzi was even more unscrupulous. With a step on his left foot, he was in his hands like a fluttering wind, and his waist was blocked. The knife quickly stunned and passed by. In the sword, the upper half of the monster brought up a swarm of blood, and went straight to the bunch of Xu Yuan to fall to the ground. Fengzi Lianxian two beasts, for the time being, silent.
That Yun never looked like the wind, but killed more than him.</p>
<p>Always avoid the momentum, stop a sword, kill three in a row.</p>
<p>There are two left, how can the swords and iron of the two be prohibited.</p>
<p>In the moment, all the seven monsters were all accountable.</p>
<p>When the two of them started, they had heard the large group of loud roar in the basin, and they were crowded up like waves.</p>
<p>First thought that the main brain of the beast died, might be shocked.</p>
<p>Who knows that this kind of thing is very close, growing up the mountains, and has never been attacked.</p>
<p>In addition to being born with birth, one thing is made of one thing, only to know that the enemy is together.</p>
<p>From top to bottom, it was originally a flat hillside, which is close.</p>
<p>This large group of monsters running like rolling thousands of black waves in the empty layer of black waves, all -hoof dust, the group roar is shocking, and the momentum is huge.</p>
<p>At this time, the two people were covered with dense clouds, surrounded by thousands of beasts, and they could not be retired or retreat.</p>
<p>Those monsters are all vertical jumps, and they come together, and they have three heads and six arms, and they are also invincible.</p>
<p>Once it was poured by it, it immediately became meat mud.</p>
<p>At the time of this crisis, although he knew despair, he could not help but think of escape.</p>
<p>At the time of Zhang Huang&rsquo;s four, the clouds on his head rose to about two feet.</p>
<p>At a glance, the clouds saw the clouds and fog promoted.</p>
<p>On the hillside that was far away, two or three ancient trees were exposed, and most of them were surrounded.</p>
<p>The upper half of the treetops were still hidden in the clouds.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, greeted the Fengzi in his mouth, and a few times under his feet, and he reached the tree.</p>
<p>Fengzi rushed to the sky because of the thousands of thousands of beasts, and there was only half a mile apart.</p>
<p>They knew that the escape was no longer there.</p>
<p>From the vertical to the tree, Yun followed.</p>
