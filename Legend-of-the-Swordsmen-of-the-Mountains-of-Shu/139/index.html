    <h1>Three -eight rounds of shock beasts, Zeng Datuko Gaishan Grain Deep Forest</h1>
    <p>Three -eight rounds of shock beasts, Zeng Datuko Gaishan Grain Deep Forest  Only the two were settled, and I thought of the monster several feet high.</p>
<p>Although this tree is high, what is the use?</p>
<p>I just wanted to find another place to escape.</p>
<p>The small group headed by that was about a hundred hundred, and I had rushed to the seven dead beasts.</p>
<p>Looking at each other on all sides, there is no way out.</p>
<p>He had to hold the blade, relying on the branches of the tree, to kill one by one, where to fight.</p>
<p>When Zhengding looked down, the hundreds of beasts ran to the dead beasts, and suddenly they moved forward, and they turned around the dead beast.</p>
<p>If you do n’t enter the front, the back is still running forward and colliding with each other.</p>
<p>It is hoped that when you see a few times in the front and rear, it is a piece of gray black, and it fluctuates and fluctuates in the shadow of the dust.</p>
<p>It seems to be several times more than at the beginning.</p>
<p>Gradually the large group behind it will be squeezed with the front group, and only two of the small groups are doubled in the small group than the biggest to kill the talents.</p>
<p>Two laps, yelled twice.</p>
<p>These two big ones want to be the main brain of the thousands of beasts.</p>
<p>Its roar, all the strange Lu was shocked.</p>
<p>This time, it was a kind of thing that hurt her, and the sympathy of revenge was not better than the ordinary howling of the talented people at first glance.</p>
<p>Coupled with the echo of Konggu, it was like thousands of Thunder at the same time.</p>
<p>In the roar, the two big beasts stood up like a group of chickens, and looked at the big trees that were stored in the two.</p>
<p>He roared again, and his legs raised, and he would come over.</p>
<p>Following the hundreds of the hundreds of them, they all followed the head and made the front and vertical potentials.</p>
<p>At this time, the danger of the two people was really impossible.</p>
<p>Those monsters are rushing one by one, and they can also start with a sword bayonet and kill one by one.</p>
<p>Although there are too many here, I ca n’t see it in the back.</p>
<p>I only know that I desperately move forward, and I wo n’t kill a hundred punishments, making it difficult to retreat, and it is easier to cope with it.</p>
<p>This two hundred penetrates the trees at the same time, and thousands of thousands of behind will be launched.</p>
<p>There are dozens of other trees in Xiu Dao, and they will be overwhelmed by them.</p>
<p>Under the wood, is there a person?</p>
<p>During this critical crisis, Yun saw two feet away from the fierce glance, and two large trees were arranged side by side, and the branches were connected.</p>
<p>Just as the thousands of monsters will be unprepared, pull the wind with your hands, first put your feet on the trunk, and hook the opposite branches with one hand.</p>
<p>On the tree, in the dense leaves.</p>
<p>Fengzi also put the knife with a knife, as much as possible.</p>
<p>As soon as I had to stand firm, I saw a hundred gusts of gusts in the following 100 shadows.</p>
<p>Then he listened to the sound, a towering ancient tree, folded the branches when he boarded, and the upper half of the tree was down from the air.</p>
<p>The sound of the roar of the beasts sounded.</p>
<p>Looking at the spirit, those monsters listened to the first big beast order, as if they had suffered too much loss, and they roared each other.</p>
<p>Yun fled from other trees from the wind and Fengzi, but they were not seen by them, and only trampled on the broken branches and leaves.</p>
<p>Just listen to the branches and leaves that are broken and the sound of the beasts, and it is chaotic.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the residual branches are discounted, and the broken leaves are like powder.</p>
<p>A large tree of ancient trees was stepped into a flat pile by them.</p>
<p>The two of them were fortunate to see.</p>
<p>Suddenly listening to the big one who kept his head down in the broken leaves and smelling, seemed to be looking for enemies.</p>
<p>The two of them were hidden in the dense leaf, seeing the beasts marching around the trees, scared.</p>
<p>There are many branches in the treetops of the partial treetops, and they happen to be kicked on it by the wind.</p>
<p>Although there is a sound to be broken, it has been hidden by the beast howl.</p>
<p>When Fengzi felt a soft soles and quickly moved to other places, a three feet long dried in the soles of the feet had been folded and fell down.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, he was hitting the head of the monster under the tree.</p>
<p>The beast was shocked, and he shouted immediately, raised his head, and as the branches trembled on the leaf, they saw the two realistic, and then yelled.</p>
<p>Below below the beasts back together, and Ong&rsquo;s head looked up.</p>
<p>In addition to the place where the two are stored, there is nothing else to hide.</p>
<p>Below is a large black pressure, all of which are crowded by the beasts, not even the foothold.</p>
<p>I just said secretly: &ldquo;I will rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard the beasts below the below, and the sound was different from the talent. Fang thought it was going to make a momentum. In addition to the dead, he saw that there were two golden threads on the back of this beast, which was more sick than electricity, and instantly came in front of him. Where the scriptures are, the beasts are chaotic, like a black wave rolling. The two golden lines flew in front of them, just on the back of the beast, and flew towards the big trees in the two. Listening to the screams in my ears, there were so many groups of black shadows fell from near the trunk, and I didn&rsquo;t see a clearly in my busyness. Each of them was preparing to fight the beast. When the two yellow shadows of the enemy were going to the enemy, someone called someone called the voice of the young master. Although the beast below the hustle and bustle of the beast, without hearing the truth, Yun Cong felt that the person&rsquo;s voice was very familiar. Fengzi&rsquo;s eyes were brave, and the two yellow shadows that had been seen early were two inhuman monsters. There was a red boy with a leather around his back. Like the two said last night, his hands were chaotic, and his mouth called the young master in his mouth. At the same time, the first hundred and ten monsters came to the trees. In this crispness, the momentum is extremely fast.  Fengzi only heard the sound of a buckle in his ears, a flower in front of him, the back of the man&rsquo;s monster was divided into the long arm, and the close -up branches were completely destroyed, and they shouted, &ldquo;Not good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hit the head, but the monster&rsquo;s two claws had grasped the tree body, and the two arms were long and fast. They just reached out and caught Fengzi&rsquo;s iron. Fengzi felt very strong, and he was uncomfortable to stand in the tree. He grabbed the tree with his left hand in the busyness, and he took his right hand with all his strength. Two times in the back, the monster was learning the monster howl, and shouted, &ldquo;Master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is his own! &ldquo;At this time You can also hear people&rsquo;s words. From the handheld sword, seeing the beasts did not retreat, the monster came again, and Yuan was ready to fight. Seeing that two yellow shadows just flew near the tree, seeing the shape, one in the inside suddenly turned over and retreated; the other was carrying a person on his back, as if he was familiar, and it was still like flying. He was about to compete with the sword, and welcomed the enemy with Fengzi, and at a glance, he saw the crowd in the population on the back of the beast, and his hands were chaotic. Take a closer look, it is the personal book boy Xiao San, who had lost the insulation ridge by accident and lost in the night of the deserted mountains, could not help but be surprised and happy. He even shouted that Fengzi stopped his hands. I had to go over the branches, and shouted loudly in Fengzi&rsquo;s ear: &quot;</p>
<p>This monster is on his back with his own person, presumably there is no maliciousness.&rdquo; Fengzi just heard a little bit, and the monsters on the opposite side seemed to have. Awareness, even relieved his claws to open the sword, whistled, and traveled to the tree. From the time of seeing the monster looking back, Yun&rsquo;s back was colorful, with a long hair of long blond hair. I thought of walking a mistake before going to the deserted mountains and lost the small three children. Together with Xiao San&rsquo;er, of course, friends are not enemies. When the two yellow shadows flew in the first two yellow shadows, they saw the beast group chaos. Before flying to the tree, it was the first hundred and ten monsters. It was waving by a long arms in the inside and falling. Unexpectedly.  At this time, Xiao San&rsquo;er had been vented from the back of the monster to the branches, and met with Yun. The master and servant had a stomach that he wanted to say, but the beast screaming was noisy, and he couldn&rsquo;t hear it. In the anxiety, Xiao San&rsquo;er pointed out with his hands. When Yun Zhi and Fengzi looked down below, because the two monsters flew from behind the beast group, the monster headed by the monsters was not yet conscious, and was waiting to find revenge. A few. Then I knew that the nemesis came, and the limbs that had been frightened and fell down. If you have not raised it, as soon as you see it, he screamed in unison and fled desperately. Most of the beasts, the road was blocked by itself, where to escape. In the dozens of dusty shadows, I was crowded, trampled on each other, and made a bunch of chaos. The beasts in front did not know to escape, and the behind were scared to drill into the group by the monster. The more crowds these beasts, the more the two monsters on the back of the backs seemed to be anxious. Suddenly raised his body at the same time, and went to Mercedes on the top of the thousands of beasts. Together with long arms, he grabbed one claw and threw dozens of feet away. Wherever you go, the shadow of the group, flying all over the sky, like two golden threads flashed in the thousand hectings of black waves. Those monsters are the same group, just jumping in the sorrow, Wu Zi will not find a way to escape.  The two monsters with golden backs leapd in the beast group for a while, and suddenly gathered in one place, loudly. One of them ran to the front, and only a little yellow star flashed in a blink of an eye. The other flew back, even on the tree power, and screamed in a row to Xiao San&rsquo;er, and his long arm claws were waving. Xiao San&rsquo;er motioned with his hand, pulled Yun Cong, Fengzi, and went to the tree first. Like that monster, put it on the ground, raised his arms together, and moved up. Seeing those monsters when Yun Cong and Fengzi saw it, they were all bold and shocked. Thousands of beast groups have not yet retreated, and there is no good strategy except for it. Afterwards, Xiao San&rsquo;er and the monster led the way in the front, and walked to the mountain.
At this time, the clouds were open, and the inclined sun still had surplus.</p>
<p>Although the dust and sand are diffused, the roar shocks.</p>
<p>On the mountain, there are mountains like embroidery, condensed purple soings, showing grass and fluffy.</p>
<p>The monster walked up and picked up Xiao San&rsquo;er again, and his expression was very close.</p>
<p>From time to time, we looked at the two, and saw that the two were not slow to walk, and they looked like a blood that seemed to be red, like joy.</p>
<p>After walking with Erluo Road, the clouds and Fengzi first looked back and looked down.</p>
<p>The beast group behind was still squeezing into sadness.</p>
<p>I was watching, and suddenly listened to Xiao San&rsquo;er calling loudly, and quickly followed.</p>
<p>The quoted monster has gone into a boulder seam.</p>
<p>The stone seam is high, a few feet wide, and there are reckless obstructions outside.</p>
<p>The two went in and took a look.</p>
<p>They were very bumpy and dark.</p>
<p>The twists and turns were more than three feet far, and the sky was suddenly seen.</p>
<p>When you go out, there are cliffs on both sides, about four or five feet apart.</p>
<p>The difference between the two cliffs is also a few feet, and it comes down.</p>
<p>In addition, there is no way to communicate, I do n’t know what the monster is introduced here.</p>
<p>As soon as I asked, Xiao San&rsquo;er had pulled the monster, came with tears, kneeling on the ground.</p>
<p>Yun Cong quickly aroused, and gave Fengzi a Changli, and then talked about it.</p>
<p>Xiao San&rsquo;er pointed at the monster: &ldquo;This is a little wife. Although it is a strange type, it is already psychic, and he can know the human language. Its mother is under the door of the immortal. Born, in the long -term, more and more, people are hard to live when they encounter it. Often, two or three days are endless. This basin is from no one, which is the nest of these beasts. I do n’t know how to get there? Last night, the young couple wanted to meet with the young master and brought a letter to the family. Because the mother of its mother saw it from the hexagram, it said that it could not meet with the birth of the mother and daughter in the past two days. , So I followed me yesterday, just waiting for Master Master to sleep in the evening. The young master wanted to copy this wild mountain road to Sichuan. Although this road is almost almost, there are also greedy medicinal materials. . It should be from the forest, do not take the small slope, go south, and go to the south. There is still a ridge that is similar to here. It is farther than here. Don’t be there, the small one hasn&rsquo;t seen them go back all the way, presumably the beasts have been stepped on to death. This is not good. Last night, I saw the young master, and I wanted to escort behind him at the time. A horror. Because the small wife should take a switching elixir today, it is a small forgotten home. Because the owner has two mountains to lead, he will not meet the beasts, so he has to go back. After taking the medicine today, the small one is the small one. If you are not at ease, you are looking for two tracks with his mother and daughter. Although you find a few roads, you do n’t encounter it. I thought it was wrong to go back and rushed back. Even the two mountains disappeared. It is to enter the beast hole by mistake, and make a small reminder. Its mother and daughter can see the character movements of one or twenty or twenty, and when they arrive, they see the beasts and flutter the tree. Claws are very sharp. If you are big, you can reach ten feet high. Its mother and daughter see that the tree has been poured down and trampled there. The road was all covered by the beasts, and the stone seam was unable to live in. In addition to the little wife jumped to the cliff, they had to wait until the little mother -in -law bombarded the beast to find the land to sleep. &quot;</p>
<p>The words are not over, the monster is screaming at the small three children. Xiao San&rsquo;er said to Yun Cong again: &ldquo;Little wife said, although the mother of its mother could not see the birth of people in these two days, it took it to the time that it had passed. A few days ago, it was ordered to pick medicine and saw the future. There are poisonous insects, and I am afraid that Master Shao will meet again, willing to escort with each other, go to the ground, and break up again. &quot;</p>
<p>Yun Cong heard the words, he was happy in his heart. Since the birth of Fengzi, except for the monk, he has been taken away from his unmanned power, and his talented iron is almost taken away by it, which is very shocked. At this time, it was a closer look at it, yellow hair, and blond hair, and the shape was not bad in shape as the Ershan people said. Xiao San&rsquo;er was born like that, but the two were husbands and wives, and they were already funny. I thought: &ldquo;This thing is longer than the body, it looks like a monkey and does not like monkeys. I don&rsquo;t know what kind of beasts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was curious in my heart, and whispered to ask Yun to ask Xiao San&rsquo;er. Who knew that the monster Er Cong was extremely extremely, and suddenly he pointed at Fengzi a few times. Yun Cong said that it was able to speak people, maybe it was unhappy, and he was having a recklessness of Fengzi. With his opinion, Xiao Saner had said, &ldquo;Little wife said, Master Shang means, and want to ask the little wife from Small on behalf of it. It is called a long -arm golden cricket, which is a god and beast that stains the brain of the hundred beasts. When its mother gave birth to it, one day caught dozens of tigers and leopards, and it was about to cracked the brain. Its owner lacked the master and was cruel. At that time, he beheaded it with a flying sword. Its mother has cultivated for many years, has a spirituality, and sorrows in Voldemort. With the nature of evil and evil, he put it under the door and adopted the medicine to keep the hole. The little wife was very small because of the same kind and did not have a spouse. On the day, I went to Chengdu with the young master on the day. When I was sick. When the master went to see the water, a wild dog suddenly came to eat the small one. At that time, the small one had scared to death, and the body seemed to be caught in the sky by the sky. I have to wake up, and I am in the cave, and the illness is getting better. There are two mothers and daughters standing next to it. First of all, I was so scared to die; then I saw it with the fruit to feed it. Ask for it, ask it to guide the mountains and meet the young master. Its mother and daughter actually said that they discussed each other for a while. The little mother -in -law took a small piece of coat, raised a basket fruit, and ran out of the hole. On the third day, he became a couple. There was more than a day, and the mother and daughter were led by the master and daughter. When he knew that the little wild dog was pushed down, he was rescued by it and asked the master again. After Lingdan, I had to live. The ticked basket was picked up in the mountains before, because I was afraid that the young master had a lack of food and pretended to be sent away. And because the young master had a fairy sword, the man and the beast were unprepared, and the fear of the human beast was unable to get up. I misunderstood, I dare not show up. I had to see the young master with a small bloody clothing first, and then secretly added the fruit to the basket every day, and then escorted it to the end of the insulating ridge to turn around. Just to prevent the body of the body, the participation is the superior Dharma. The small foundation is not deep. It is not worthy of being his apprentice. It only passes a little bit of body practice. Later, the little mother -in -law asked several times. The master said that the small opportunity was another opportunity, but he never arrived, and he was always unwilling to keep it. This Yamarang was connected to the deserted mountains of the young master. Living in the Beishan top cave. For a long time on this day, you can know its mother and daughter language. It is not very common to say that it is also used to it. I just thought about Master Young. Looking at it from a distance, there are Han people passing by. I did not expect that the young master would go through this pass. I wanted to take care of a peaceful letter. I came back on my mother -in -law. The owner said that in the past two days Delivery, its mother and daughter must be dangerous, and the small couples do not know the offenders. Back to the cave to send a letter, there are four people, there are actually young masters. You must not allow it. The small one can&rsquo;t, you have to discuss the two sides in the distance, the deadline for two days, and then see each other, so you follow the young master. When you walk in the evening, the young master enters the hole in the cave. Sleeping, Xiao&rsquo;s suddenly insisted on entering the cave, but not talking. The little wife was strong but I had to carry the small entry. Seeing that the young master had fallen asleep, happy, and sad, he almost cried. At that time, there was no awakening. Because the little wife was taking the master -shaped elixir given by the master today, she had to go back. When he came out of the hole, his mother -in -law came, and said that Xiao did not listen to the master&rsquo;s words. The young couple repeatedly said that they did not talk to the young master, and they were furious. Today, I am afraid that I will take the same mistake again, and I am inseparable. It was not until the afternoon for a while, and the calculation time limit will be full before it is allowed to follow. I found several ways, I couldn&rsquo;t find it, and I almost mistakenly misunderstood. Now that its mother and daughter keeps the master&rsquo;s lesson, they have not eaten flesh and blood, and they have been eaten all year round, nor do they kill the souls. Otherwise, the beasts do not know how much to die today. Yun Cong and Fengzi heard that, because the long -armed golden crickets could speak people, they would like to thank it together. That Jin Yan seemed to know politely and made a good gratitude.
This seat is at dusk.</p>
<p>The three of them were sitting on the rocks, and they saw the Yin Yin of the cliff vine.</p>
<p>For a long time, I couldn&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>Because the mountain was cold and cold, I was discussing with Xiao San&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a mountain wind was blowing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the food foods were all on the mountain people.</p>
<p>Saying the two mountain people, because they were anxious to listen to Xiao San&rsquo;er in danger, and did not talk about it, they told Xiao San&rsquo;er.</p>
<p>Xiao San&rsquo;er heard the words, and was busy asking his wife to go to find long -arms.</p>
<p>The words were right, his wife got up, and when the stone cracks went, the stone seam was out.</p>
<p>Fengzi was afraid of hurting the two people&rsquo;s lives, and was busy running out.</p>
<p>Behind it shouted, &ldquo;This matter is not blame them, only take the bags, and you need to kill them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, a golden shadow is like a star like a star. Flying, I have worn it on the top of the mountain, and I don&rsquo;t know where to go. Looking at the under the mountain, I saw the crowds of all heads, the smoke and dust permeated, and the sound of the roar still did not decrease. There are too many beasts, and it takes time to retreat, and then he turned back and said to Yun. Xiao San&rsquo;er said: &ldquo;Master Young Master is not worried about no place, and his young wife returns. If the beast has not returned, it can be carried up with the young mother -in -law with the young mother -in -law. Live in the cave for one night, and the mother and daughter will be escorted out of the mountains by the mother and daughter tomorrow morning. &quot;</p>
<p>Fengzi Person said:&rdquo; I see you walking up and it is back. Empty? &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao San&rsquo;er said:&rdquo; It&rsquo;s just a little bit slower than its mother and daughter. I was anxious to see the young master, so I called it back, not to walk. It&rsquo;s. &quot;</p>
<p>When Fengzi heard the words, haha ​​laughed and said, &ldquo;My elder brother often mentioned you with me, saying that you are smart and loyal, but unfortunately in the barren mountains, you can&rsquo;t even find the bones, just leave you a grave. Dead, marry a good mother -in -law, who is skillful, and even if you go out, no matter how much dangerous roads you go, how good this is! But my brother is a master who is about to become a monk. You just care about it, it sounds like my brother has become vulgar, how good our brothers are together. &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao San heard about what dare to respond. Yun Cong did not feel first because he was used to listening, and he didn&rsquo;t feel it first, and he heard the words of Fengzi, and also said, &ldquo;If you change it, let alone the help of life. Dare to dare. Later, Feng Zi was anxious, and Yun Cong repeatedly persuaded him to avoid many humble calls.  The three were arguing that the long -armed golden mother and daughter suddenly arrived at the same time, with the parcels of the two in their hands. Did you hurt the two mountain people? Xiao San&rsquo;er asked his wife a few words, answered that the two mountain people wanted to take risks from the clouds and fled to run over the ridge. The loss of the backpack fell on the stalagmites on the side of the mountain and died in the chest. Another somehow was entangled by a lurking mountain snake and was earning his life. He was rushed to be killed by his wife&rsquo;s wife, killed the snake, saved it, and he had died, and only found him back. Yun Cong and Fengzi remembered that this kind of people&rsquo;s specialty killed the Han people to eat, escaped by danger, and blame themselves. And Xixi Kaiqian has not been started. Somehow, they will be assisted by the two mountains. They are brought to the mountains who have lost their feet. They are not entangled by the poisonous snake. Fortunately. Xiao San&rsquo;er also said that after seeing the two and her bag, his wife came back and met his mother, saying that today is a season. Those beasts gathered in the mountain basin to match the sun, and they became more loved. Following the precepts of its master, dare not kill more, and spent a little better hands and feet before they forced them to go on the road. Now they have retreated into a forest east. There are too many beast groups, and at least two hours will be after the retreat. Fei Yun was hungry from waiting, and rushed back to ask Yun Cong what was going on? If you want to move forward at night, you need to follow the method of Xiaosan&rsquo;er, hold it from his mother and daughter, and walk from the beast back. If you want to live temporarily, there is a tiger and leopard nest acupoint for the cliff. Over the night for a while, the beasts will definitely go back tomorrow morning and go on the road again. From today, Yun was frightened and lacks, and then he had to fly over the beast back of ten miles. Because of the reunion of Xiaosan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s exotic, I couldn&rsquo;t follow with it this time. I really wanted to talk about it. Fortunately, busy this night is not time. After tomorrow, I still have to rest. It is better to sleep well tonight. Fengzi was mainly from the cloud, and a slight discussion was used to adopt the second method.  However, the two cliffs are wide, and the difference between up and down is very different. Fengzi always feels that based on his own ability, he also let a big mother monkey carrying the back of the past, sorry; jump over alone without confidence. I had a good idea long ago, and at first sight, Xiao San&rsquo;er ordered his wife to recite, and said to him, &quot;</p>
<p>You call it slowly, first go back, let me see, I can learn it, I can take the same way, I can take the same way. In the past, it was better, and I ca n’t think about it again. It is a woman. It does n’t matter if you carry it back. He carried us indecently. &ldquo;Xiao Saner&rsquo;s wife heard the words, looking at Fengzi, grinning and smiling. Running towards the cliff, two long arms waved, his legs were together, and his blond hair was erected in the back of his head. As he squatted and squatted, he flew like the cliff. Seeing it in the air, the two long arms were flat, as if pressing a few presses, as if the wings of the birds were moving. In the secret, he was struggling to work hard, and he learned the method of being light and luck. He still learned twice, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but realize it. I was trying to take a risk. I heard that the wife of Xiao San&rsquo;er shouted at the cliff. Its mother had also flew over, and she explored the cliff for a while before flying back together. There was a long string of things behind him. From the perspective of Yun and Fengzi, it was the vines with more than 20 years in two plates, and it was straightened by it. The two paws of Xiao San&rsquo;er held their heads and shouted twice to Xiao San&rsquo;er. Its mother was on the vine, and the front and rear claws were separated, grabbing the vine. Xiao San&rsquo;er asked Yun to ride on it and passed it. Yun never looks like Fengzi. In addition, the two cliffs are low, and the situation is dangerous. When you come, you will feel dazzling. At first I thought that it was carried by her mother and daughter, and saw this situation. Sound: &quot;</p>
<p>I offended!&rdquo; The golden lady used all the way, and in a blink of an eye, he had gone through the vine.  Fengzi had already folded a few bamboo poles, tied it into cross with a strap, and pulled two old clothes from the bag to support it. From the back of the cliff, Fengzi sang, and worked hard for his feet, with two hands, and went to the cliff. Fengzi instinctively went to the cliff, because the situation was too dangerous, and he was a little dazzling at first. As soon as he got up, there was something in his hand, and it was easy to pass by. Yun never knew that he came to this hand, and saw that he raised his body. Fang Dai squeezed a cold sweat, and Fengzi had arrived. In this case, Hugh said that Yun Cong and Xiao San&rsquo;er were shocked, and even the long -armed golden mother and daughter felt surprised. When Fengzi rises, the old Jinyu is still afraid of losing, and he still supports it from the vine. Seeing that the wind is no, he will cross the Primary Three. Its daughter has also traveled with it. The old Jinye had already moved forward, rolled over the cliff, and after a while, he listened to the voice of the tiger. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the past. I saw that under the sunlight, there were long sizes of six or seven rush tigers rushing through the mountain to escape. Entering the tiger&rsquo;s hole, ordered the candlelight to see, there were two milk tigers who had just born, and they saw the long -armed golden mother and daughter, scared and jumped. Xiao San&rsquo;er&rsquo;s wife had run out of the hole at this time. Clouds and Fengzi each take dry food and meat. Xiao San&rsquo;er had been away from the fireworks for a long time, and it was very fragrant. The golden lady is no longer moving. After waiting for a while, Xiaosan&rsquo;s wife didn&rsquo;t see it, and Lao Jinyu gradually showed some irritability. Yun Cong asked Xiaosan&rsquo;er&rsquo;s wife to go? Xiao San&rsquo;er replied: &quot;</p>
<p>It was because of this, and I wanted to pick up some gifted gifted. I didn&rsquo;t want to go to the time before.&rdquo; Between the question and answer, Lao Jinyu suddenly stood up and roared towards Xiao Saner. After a few times, I ran outside the cave.  Yun Congxue is looking for his daughter. Ask the younger child, it really is not bad. Xiao San&rsquo;er also said that his mother -in -law had been able to be psychic, because this time his wife had a long time, thinking of his master&rsquo;s words, and he might be encountered on the way. When Fengzi heard the words, he replied, &quot;</p>
<p>It has helped us so busy. How can we care about it? Anyway, we have nothing to do with it. We also followed to find it, helping it to help it? &ldquo;Yun Congfang wanted to say that the two pairs were very different, and the old Jinji had been going for a while. How can we look for it? Xiao San&rsquo;er has answered happily: &quot;</p>
<p>The little ones are also anxious for its mother and daughter. If the two masters are helped, it will not be better.&rdquo; Yun Congzhi knows that the magical skills such as the Jinye, it is not invincible, it is more than a person, and it is more than herself. Not an enemy. But this is the end of the matter.
At this time, Xiao San&rsquo;er did not return for half an hour because Lao Jinyu went back for half an hour.</p>
<p>There is a piece of jujube forest in half miles, where there are good ginseng jujube.</p>
<p>This jujube is two or three inches long, sweet and crispy and fragrant.</p>
<p>Rare, somehow, even his mother couldn&rsquo;t come.</p>
<p>It must be in response to its owner and met dangerous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the way, it seemed to fly forward. Yun Cong and Fengzi knew that Xiao San&rsquo;er was very fast, and it was not that his wife&rsquo;s strap was needed. Because he was young again, he was trying to persuade him. He was in front of a piece of Guangping, and he saw that Xiao San&rsquo;er slammed forward and listened to it, and suddenly his complexion changed tragically. For the two -person way: &quot;</p>
<p>My wife and mother -in -law must have been poisoned, either seriously injured, can&rsquo;t act, or they are caught. I will go to the previous look. I will follow the two masters.&rdquo; Take a big step, desperately, run towards the woods in front of the Guangping. Feng Zi didn&rsquo;t hold it, and just shouted, &quot;</p>
<p>What are you busy, go a piece!&rdquo; Hearing the two beasts, it was the voice of the mother and daughter. Fengzi quickly lived and quietly said to the cloud: &quot;</p>
<p>Looking at this spirit, the coming person must be not small. I will wait, I need to take wisdom, do not fight the enemy. I often run away from the mountains and observe the situation. Don&rsquo;t step forward, wait for me to return to the reality and return to the rescue, so as not to lose. &ldquo;Yun Congzhi knows that he is also difficult to hear, and he would like to listen, and then replied:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everything is determined by it. I can&rsquo;t wait until now, let&rsquo;s go together. &ldquo;Fengzi couldn&rsquo;t, had to pull out the iron and waist knife, Yun Cong also pulled out the frost sword and ran forward together.  The closer to the woods, the more the sorrows of the golden mother and daughter heard the more realistic. The two followed the sound of the sound, and when they entered the forest, the depths of the forest and the darkness were dark. I saw some of the broken lights from the dense leaf gap, and the wind was chaotic. There are nothing except trees. There were about two mile roads in the forest, and suddenly the eyes were on, and a large number of Shiping appeared in the forest center. The closer the two, the closer to the golden mother and daughter, they paid more attention to the eyes. As soon as the sound of howling was issued, it was not far ahead, stopped early, and moved forward with his hands lightly. Close to Shiping, Fengzi first hidden behind a big tree and looked forward. A stone furnace was set up on the Shiping, and the two or three -inch wide black smoke was up. After a while, they will fall and enter the furnace. A little Taoist with a rabbit head and a rabbit brain was set behind the furnace. Looking at him again, there were more than two feet away from the little Taoist priest. Golden Mother and Daughter are holding a stone pillar near the forest on the front side, where there is a sorrow, and there are several black straps around the body, which is similar to the furnace smoke. The two knew that they were trapped by the Boy&rsquo;s Demon Fa, and they couldn&rsquo;t think of saving it. Looking at the little Taoist again, I saw a small three -foot -round stone that fixed the small three -foot -rounded stone, and covered it with his hands and feet lightly, as if he had to hit the traveler&rsquo;s head. Seeing that there was only two feet away from the little Taoist, the stone was raised with both hands, as if it was stopped by something, and immediately touched it, and the stone fell down. The Boy was still unprepared and never even returned. I was so scared that Xiao San&rsquo;er crawled up quickly and fled into the forest. At this time, the golden mother -in -law and daughter were so anxious. After a while, I saw Xiao San&rsquo;er bypassing the forest on the front side, walking towards the trapped place of the golden mother -in -law, and shouted, &quot;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s die!&rdquo; Then he rushed to his wife. On the top of the stone pillar, a black smoke rose, and the little three were wrapped together.  When Fengzi saw such a scene, he quietly said to the cloud: &quot;</p>
<p>We all die is not good. Big brothers can&rsquo;t step forward, wait for me to borrow your sword.&rdquo; Take the creamy sword and run forward. Yun Congfang thought that Fengzi would be poisoned. Whoever thought that Fengzi had a mind, and not far in front of the stone pillar, he even settled, and he took the sword in his hand towards the black smoke. At the glare, the black smoke was broken next to it, and it flew away from the air. Fengzi succeeded in one fell swoop, with great joy in her heart, and raised the sword in a mess. In a blink of an eye, the mother and daughter of the golden puppet and the younger three were escaped and their actions were free. The Fengzi was even more unscrupulous. He raised his sword and rushed to the furnace. He tried it with the sword first. Seeing no blocking, a drink, the right hand sword stabbed, the left hand beaten, and at the same time. The little demon was ordered to practice the law. He only thought that his master&rsquo;s demon method was sheltered. When he was young, he could do it. Unexpectedly, I encountered a frosty sword that was not afraid of evil invasion, and was used by the wind. A sword first stabbed a transparent cave, and then a brain was cracked and died.  Since the last time Yun went home in the Silkwatling Ridge, he had been with the Monk Monk and Wei Chihuo for some days. At first sight, although the little Taoist died, the corpse did not fall, and the black smoke in the furnace could not hold it. He knew that it was a demon and evil law. I was busy leaving, and the golden mother -in -law and daughter had already looked at it in a long time, and suddenly she sowed in her mouth and ran down. On the one, he first picked up Xiao San&rsquo;er; the old golden trail ran to the cloud from the cloud, Fengzi, stretched out his long arms, pinched one, and pulled his head to rush into the forest in front. Well, Fengzi screamed all the way, shouting, &quot;</p>
<p>I will go, let go!&rdquo; The old golden mother and daughter did not ignore it. The action was like flying. In the moment, there were three dozens of miles out. After passing a cliff hole, I drilled in before putting the Yun from the clouds and Fengzi, and shouted dozens of sounds to Xiao San&rsquo;er. Xiao San&rsquo;er walked over and said, &quot;</p>
<p>Shangye is resting. My wife is the most delicious because of the most delicious jujube there. There is no other place. I don&rsquo;t want to take it in the forest. Fa, put a few black smoke and trap it on the stone pillar. The monster and apprentices were originally three young and old. One of the guardian Dan furnaces has never been actions. After the old demon caught my wife, right Another little demon said: He sacrificed the spell there, and it was over the heat. Only the seven boys he caught suddenly took off one and could not do it. I can&rsquo;t bear to feel it. I am embarrassed and I never want to help the success. I actually caught such a spirit beast in my unconsciousness. Although it was a mother, I just re -refined the treasure of Xuanyin Liuyang. It seemed very happy, and said that he was going to take the six boys and boys, and even my wife used the soul to help the guardian. After a while, the little demon road suddenly ran into the left wooden forest, pulled a twelve or three -year -old child out. First, he cried a few words, then picked up the child, and whispered to the little monster of the meditation. After saying a few words. When my wife saw the old demon, I was struggling desperately without hearing. Suddenly, when I saw a golden light, the little monster was holding the child away. After a while, my mother -in -law was Come here, because of the lack of masters with the attendant, as soon as it arrives, it can see that it is a demon and evil law. My wife, Lian Shizhu, took away and asked its owner to rescue. I thought that I was thinking about the master of the master in my mouth, and the little demon road was settled again. The demon method is powerful, and the black smoke on the stone pillar is actually alive. When the person is stained, he can&rsquo;t get rid of it. Only the hand is close to the stone pillar, and the black smoke is tied up. My mother -in -law saw that I told me not to be near. I want to go back and ask for the lack of the master to rescue. It is too far apart. Without my wife&rsquo;s back, it must be no longer. He secretly smashed him. As soon as he was close to him, he seemed to have a great power to block me and hit it back. This disaster was caused by me who did not listen to the master&rsquo;s words. Female, for a while, want to die together. She just ran to its mother and daughter, and was coming to the Shang Ye. This fairy sword is really a baby. Dao also died on this sword. When the young master urged everyone to leave, my mother -in -law and wife went to the old monster for a while, and I was afraid he would come and look at it. Smoke, flying from behind, there are only more than ten miles apart. I know that I have to pass my lips and tongue, I am afraid that it is too late. I had to follow the power. The mother and daughter fled the three of us. The black smoke wanted to be carrying the six boys, flying fast, otherwise he was chased by the merchant, maybe he was poisoned. Now the road to Sichuan and our cave has passed the demon. The place where the Tao is entangled, Tianming can be able to move, so I dare not determine. &quot;
The words are not over.</p>
<p>As soon as Fengzi heard the demon road, he had six young children, and he couldn&rsquo;t help hate and angry, so he said to Yun Cong that he would use the sword to kill the demon road and rescue the six boys and boys.</p>
<p>Come.</p>
<p>Yun Cong heard the words surprised: &ldquo;This incident is a righteousness. Although we have a sip of a fairy sword, they will not be spell. The little demon road is killed because of being fixed. Be careful. &quot;</p>
<p>Fengzi said:&rdquo; We are now going to learn sword fairy, how can we see death or not? If we died, we have died several times. Will you give your life? We do n’t know if we do n’t know if we know, how can we do it? I know that it ’s not bad, but also like his apprentice. ? &quot;</p>
<p>When he heard that, he felt that although the things were strange, the demon road was all evil, knowing that the pebbles were out of mind, and no reason. Then he promised Fengzi and went together. Fengzi pushed the sword with only one bite. Yun never had a light body, and it was useless to go. The two were arguing, and the old Jinye called a few times to Xiao San. Xiao San&rsquo;er said to the two: &ldquo;My mother -in -law said, it also hates the demon way. Although the demon method is powerful, like using the immortal sword to kill his apprentice, he suddenly stabbed him when he was not prepared. As long as you are stabbing, you can succeed. However, the incident is eventually dangerous. Go to do it. According to the little wife, when the demon practice, he also closed his eyes, as if he was unknown, only orally. If he met him, it would be better. &quot;</p>
<p>It was invalid, so I had to tell Fengzi repeatedly: &ldquo;Although the old Jinye is a alien, it is under the door of the high man. It has been psychic for a long time. If it does not call you to start, it is cautious and not to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fengzi responded one by one.  Lao Jinyu came over to carry him. Fengzi took the sword box over and still insisted on walking. Lao Jinyu had to point out the direction, with his feet up, stepping on the trees and branches. Fengzi originally knew that his mother and daughter ran fast, because he did not like the help of his nature, he thought that the journey of three or dozens of miles could arrive in a moment. But it was not so surprising that it was so surprising. When the golden line was running out of the shadow, I remembered that Shi was fled by it, and it turned around when it was out of the forest. Now it is not here. The path is unfamiliar. Besides, there is a back, and it can arrive early. It is a big deal to cut the demon. Why bother this section? Although some regrets, I thought that Jin Yan had finished the virtual reality in front of him, and he had to turn back, just holding his feet, not in a hurry. Who knows that it is estimated that there are more than thirty miles and have not yet entered the forest. They know that they go wrong, and they are afraid that Jin Yan has been poisoned by the demon. On the front of the eyes, there is a valley, one side is a slope, but there is a small lonely peak to block the road. I had to go up to the peak, and when I looked around, the road was not as big as it was just now. I only went to the road of Lugukou. Only then did I know that I was so suspicious and had not walked over. In his heart, he was busy running into the peak and rushing to the valley.  As soon as I entered Goukou, I heard that there was a question and answer after listening to the rock in Gutou, one seemed to be a child. Fengzi knows such a deserted mountain and valley, where does the human language come from? Although it is bold, I am afraid that I will encounter it unexpectedly with the demon. Hurry up, press the hilt tightly, and the stones. When I heard it, I only heard a child with a crying voice and said, &ldquo;I have not been two years since my brother left. When I went out to travel together, I didn&rsquo;t come back. Listening to my aunt said that the Normal University is a famous sword fairy, and I have a friendship with the Emei Swordsman. When my cousin is going to travel soon, I often give my brother. I do n’t know if I have met a master in the past two years? If in Chengdu, do n’t you have a bright road in front of him? The mother does n’t want to open it like Aunt Zhang&rsquo;s aunt Zhang family, and I will not worry about you. On that day, I went to Wuhou Temple to replace it. My mother wished to ask for a sign, and was caught by this demon. She never thought that my brother would be his apprentice. Fortunately, I was in a good time, seeing you look at it, and didn&rsquo;t dare to talk to you, otherwise, wouldn&rsquo;t you even hurt you? Now that my mother is still ill on the bed, I suddenly disappear when I see you again, wouldn&rsquo;t you die alive? You will let Jin Guang fly in the sky, and you will go back with me. Brother, how do you know. I have been angry with Zhang Er cousin to leave home. I originally planned not to meet the cost of sword fairy academic costs, and I would never go home. Who knows that I met this monster at the foot of the end of Nanshan this year and looked at me and forced it. It is apprentice to say that I can bear his mantle, but I have never suffered. I see his magic, often adulter to adulterate women, hurt life, and want to escape. I did n’t dare. The empty land refining method in the tree forest. After being refined, go to the mountain to find him a fellow and create a cult. He must use seven boys and boys to practice this demon method, and six hid in the cave side of the mountain first. Forbidden with spells. Finally, you can catch you, set your soul within three days, and refine the Xuanyin Liuyang fan god sword. When I see you as my brother, I am shocked and bitter. Come. Knowing that his heart is more ruthless than the wolf, begging is not only useless, I can&rsquo;t even give me a life. I lost your life and never seen him. But you are banned by spells and cannot be relieved. He goes to the forest in the forest. At that time, I did n’t ordered me this time. Although I took the time to say a few words, I still could n’t save you. I was so anxious that I cried in the sky outside the cave. I was sad to the extreme, and suddenly I met a short -old man ’s benefactor. I have the three ways and saving you. The first facade can not only save you to get rid of difficulties, but also invisible. In the second way, the truth of the passing of the dwarf people has a golden light guard and fly at will. Three ways, it was a big thunderbolt. En Gong Yuan ordered me to save you here to wait for a person, and that person was chased by the demon. I took advantage of him and shot that the thunder. I may not be able to remove him, but decide to hurt him and escape. At that time, I would be with you again, and bring the six children who are in the same difficulty to bring the second way to Chengdu. Then I will take out the money from my house and send him to him The six people went back to their hometown and reunited with their flesh. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Fengzi suddenly felt the wind behind his head. Looking back, it was the old golden scripture come back. Fengzi asked where the Demon Road is now? The old Jin Yan compared with the gesture to compare with the wind. Fengzi saw that the demon road was like the little demon. He meditated in front of the furnace and wanted to rush. Thinking of the person who talked about the latter, it was quite like a path with himself. He quickly took a look at the view, and he didn&rsquo;t know where to go. Fengzi pulled the sword out, hid behind, and walked away. The old golden magpie suddenly compared with his hands again, which means to walk with Fengzi. Fengzi did not recognize the way, and it was guided by it. At this time, there were only two or three miles away from each other, and it arrived in the blink of an eye. The old Jinye suddenly stepped forward, looked at it, and flew back to wave towards Fengzi. Although Fengzi knew that there was a change, it would be a gesture, and he also returned a gesture, indicating that his idea was set, and he had to come forward. When Lao Jinyu was still stopped, Fengzi scared the sword in his hand. Lao Jinyu couldn&rsquo;t, and had to retreat.  Fengzi didn&rsquo;t care about it, his feet lightly, and walked quietly to the open space. From the forest, the probe went out and looked at it. The demon road was extremely fierce, wearing a red gossip clothes, holding a sword with one hand, and holding a stack of chapters in one hand. Although I stood in front of the furnace with closed eyes, I was thinking in my mouth. From time to time, I pointed to the front with a sword. It was not like the little monster was sitting without moving. Looking at him again, on the stone pillar of the mother and daughter just now, there was the headless head of the little demon who was killed by himself. On the six pillars of the other, six boys and boys were tied to each other. They were all eyebrows, red lips red, and black smoke surrounded by black smoke. I saw the demon mouth read for a while, took out a small sword from the arms, and even threw the ruling towards the black smoke furnace. The black smoke disappeared immediately, and the seven shares of light and yellow light were raised. The Demon Dao first read a few spells at the dead little demon Dao. With a finger of the sword, he saw a bright red heart on the tip of the sword. I was about to throw it in the furnace. Suddenly I bowed my head and thought about it, and I stunned, fingred the sword in front of the sword, and the bloody man&rsquo;s heart on the tip of the sword suddenly disappeared. Essence Fengzi knew that the trace had been seen by the demon. When he thought that the talented mother and daughter were saved, the black smoke around was broken by the frost sword, so he was not panicked. Seeing the black smoke flying; the sword was held up, and the blue light passed on the sword, and the black smoke dissipated with the sword. Fengzi knew that he was so powerful that he couldn&rsquo;t let people, drink a lot, and go out of the forest. When he was waiting for the sword in his hand, he pierced the demon road, and the demon road had fluttered the sword light.
It turned out that the monster was caught up with the golden mother and daughter, and was overjoyed.</p>
<p>When he turned back to the nest, took the six boys and boys, prepared to get rid of the caesarean section, took away the soul, and practiced the most vicious demon method.</p>
<p>When I returned to the forest, the two golden crickets and apprentices captured by Shi Caicai were no longer knowing where they were.</p>
<p>The black evil silk on the golden stone pillar was also broken away.</p>
<p>First of all, there were enemies who could come here, broke the demon method, was shocked and hated.</p>
<p>I wanted to collect the Dan furnace, and the six boys and boys fled elsewhere.</p>
<p>Another thought: &ldquo;Recently, the general apprenticeship has been different from usual. Since taking the last boy to return to the mountain, it also looks at his face with sorrow. On the third day, the boy and man have lost his trace. At that time, although I was aware of it, because I had been with each other for a long time, I never cared. Because of the eagerness to make the spells, I went to Gushangling to meet a party with a big picture, and the boy and the man escaped. For a long time, I wanted to use him on behalf of him. Jin Yan was trapped on the stone pillar. Now that Er Jinzhang has been broken by the demon method, the eldest apprentice is missing, and the second apprentice is killed. How can the people have not taken the magic weapon in Dan furnace? The black evil silk in the furnace and the remaining six stone pillars still exists? &quot;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help moving. Occasionally, when I saw the fans of a child in the woods on the side of the body, I took it in my hand. It was what the missing boy worn. When I first caught my hand, I saw that the appearance of the boy and the man was similar to his apprentice. It was like a brothers. At that time, he moved slightly in his heart. The third day was gone. From the beginning of the eyes, it seems that the apprentice was obviously rebelled. He first let go of the missing boy, and took himself to solve the black evil silk, let go of the golden cricket, and he was afraid that his brother and brother would leak. die. The more you think about it, the more reasonable, I can&rsquo;t help but jump like a thunder, and quickly look at it in the air, without a trace of signs, and I think it is not bad. I wanted to track forced capture, and because the apprentice learned two demon methods, I could only prevent themselves from going away. The missing boy man thought it was his brother, so he fled, and he must not be far away. He must still hide it between the caves in the nearby cave, and it is difficult to escape the net for a long time. He was in a hurry to practice the Fa. He wanted to use the little apprentice to count it. He was killed today. He just happened to be sacrificed by the law while there was a demon law. Besides, the two apprentices died and fled, and the remaining six boys were inconvenient to walk with walking. They needed to be guarded in the hole. Soul, practice the demon method, and then find the traitor to leak. The idea was certain, so he solved the prohibited method, and tied his corpse and six boys to the seven stone pillars. Sit in front of the furnace, recite a spell for a while, and get up.  I just took out a heart of the little demon path with a demon method and threw it in the furnace. Seeing that under the moonlight, there seemed to be a blue light flashed in the forest shadow. Although the demon Dao is not a number of characters in the different factions, it is not an ordinary generation. Newly learned a few magic methods from a well -known party. Fengzi was just anxious to look forward carefully. If he was not careful, the sword in his hand flashed behind him, and he saw the movement. The demon road was originally hot -hearted. As soon as someone was found someone, he was busy throwing the demon&rsquo;s heart that throw the little demon path, and then drank a big teachings, then he put the black evil silk and flew towards the Fengzi. His black evil silk refining method, although the same number as the monster corpse Guchen, a monster Taoism is far away from the demon corpse Guchen, and the second is not local. Where can I stand the treasure of the fairy family, so when they wave, they will become broken, and they fly with the wind. Seeing that the black evil silk went out, he guessed that the people were not weak. After seeing the enemy coming out and raising the sword, the demon path saw that the enemy had only a good sword, and he could not fly out and operate freely. In my heart, there must be, where the wind was near, and the sleeves of the robe were raised, and there was a yellow light flying. Fengzi thought that Huang Guang was the same as Hei Shasi. When he was busy with his sword, he just felt heavily, and he realized that the enemy was a mouth flying sword. Fortunately, there is a talent and a sensitive skill. At first sight, the sword head was pressed by Huang Guang, and his strength was not small. He was busy pressing Emei Zhenzhuan with the solution of the real imperial deficiency. At the moment, one underground, one green and one yellow, and two Guanghua exchanges impacted. For a while, it was difficult to divide.  The Demon Dao first thought that Jian Guang was flying, and the enemy would be injured. And seeing the coming person, with a sword in his hand, fighting with his sword light, the blue light is still not weak, although you can&rsquo;t use it like your sword light at will, but the skills of the people are agile, the sword is high, the same is wonderful, the same is the same, the same is the same, the same is the same. High, short, dwarf, illness like lightning. At this moment, people have been seen that people are not ordinary. Coupled with the saliva of the sword, he planned to get two swords, and he commanded Huang Guang in the air to fight with the coming, but secretly showed the demon method. Fengzi was in the rough and detailed. Knowing that the sword could not break the yellow light, the enemy could use the flying sword at will, but he had to suffer energy to resist the vertical jump. The manager is not good at energy, and he has a loss of losses. He has long had the idea of ​​retreating. Huang Guang, the helpless enemy, was tightly chased, and said to escape, not even dodging. It was in a hurry, and the momentum was slightly slowed. Hundreds of busy stolen eyes, the demon road was stunned, his mouth was motionless. Just expected that the enemy had to get mysterious, and suddenly he smelled a strange smell, the black smoke surrounded, and the face flew. The shouting: &ldquo;Not good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With all the power of life, drinking, getting up, a trick of Baihong Guanri, even the person with a sword dance into a half -circle and go straight to the forest. It is also Fengzi&rsquo;s life. One demon -way ability is normal, and the flying sword is insufficient; the other is divided into some gods when exercising the demon method. When Fengzi rose, it was catching up with the yellow light. The Demon Dao knew that Fengzi&rsquo;s sword was so powerful, and he might not hurt his flying sword. Whenever Fengzi met the enemy, he always withdrawn it back and came again twice. I just retreated this time, and happened to put the Heishei up. I thought that Fengzi Feijian was tripped by Huang Guang. Pay attention to the air, it is difficult to take care of both, and only when it is wrapped. Wanwan had the help of the life -saving trick in the Emei sword method of Fengzihui, and Huang Guang was withdrawn again. It was placed by Fengzi sword light, and the black smoke was still scattered. When Huang Guang flew forward to get the enemy&rsquo;s first level, the wind broke the black evil silk, and even took the sword to get up and welcomed him. Feng Zi seemed to hear the two swords meet, and he rang a little, his body had already entered the forest, and he fled.  Seeing that the black smoke was about to fly in front of the enemy, the enemy had just fallen from the air and had not yet on the ground. At the same time, his flying sword was flying out again and twice. This situation was originally difficult to dodge. Unexpectedly, the enemy&rsquo;s feet were just dipped in the ground, like a dragon&rsquo;s water, and it raised it again. I was shocked, and when I was in confusion, I saw that the two Guanghua glory fluttered like lightning. As soon as I came into contact, I felt that I had a vitality shocked. It ’s too late to know that it’ s not good, and it ’s too late to recycle. The yellow light was hit by Qiuguang, and a few yellow stars fell; like a flying yellow snake, he was hit by a heavy thing, and meandered to the horizontal Stir away. Knowing that the flying sword was injured, he didn&rsquo;t sorry. Looking at the enemy again, the industry has gone to the forest, becoming more and more furious. Specify the air sword in the air in one hand, and then go back to a move. The black smoke in the furnace is like a smoke of a fired cigarette.  At this time, the Fengzi was like a bird of shock, and his feet were stained with the ground, and he didn&rsquo;t even look back. Not far from the escape, he listened to the wind behind his head, chased the demon road, how fast the bottom of the wind was, and it was not as good as the demon road to fly quickly. I was about to escape to Gukou, and I changed my mind: &ldquo;How are I so timid today? I can&rsquo;t beat others, how can I lead the ghost into the room and get involved in the big brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not far behind. Seeing that Fengzi couldn&rsquo;t escape anyway, he couldn&rsquo;t escape, and he pulled his heart horizontally. He simply pulled out the iron puppet behind him and was waiting for the enemy. Feng Zi was desperate, regardless of the green soap and white, holding his hands to help, holding the frosty sword in one hand to perform the Emei sword method, dancing a storm. This time, the Monster Dao had a good idea: Seeing Fengzi turned back to meet the enemy, knowing that his sword was a sword, so he couldn&rsquo;t step forward, and he couldn&rsquo;t go forward. Siege. Waiting for the wind and the power, then came in by nothing, and took his life. During less than half a cup of tea, Fengzi saw the enemy&rsquo;s intention, and secretly gritted his teeth. I thought: &ldquo;If you go on this, you will die sooner or later. Now the solution is open, except for victory, it is to save; otherwise, if you want to escape, the gesture is slightly slow, so you will lose a lot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The closeness of the close of the body seemed to not fall, and it seemed that the black smoke on the top of the yellow light became stronger and stronger, and it seemed to be shrouded. Dance with each other, with a sword, the cigarette rises again, and the demon mouth is still moving. He was originally a sword and a dance, making the power uniform, so as not to make the sword strenuous. At first sight, the demon road did not know what to make a mystery, the more I want to hate. The right hand was still a dance sword. With a solution of a pan flower cover, he took the time to raised his hand and hit the opposite demon road.
When the Demon Road was negligible, when the fish had been entered the net, when they were exhausted, they would be captured or killed.</p>
<p>Words.</p>
<p>Listening to the sound of the golden blade in front of him, looking back, a dark shadow flew on the face.</p>
<p>It was expected that when I opened it quickly, the iron karma had flown and hit the left shoulder.</p>
<p>Fengzi was born with great magical power, and when he was extremely angry, he made his strength more fierce.</p>
<p>He was seriously injured here, and his vitality was scattered.</p>
<p>The Fengzi accidentally took the sword to dance, and even a few times, it was scattered, and the backbone retreat.</p>
<p>Fengzi escaped at this time, and he couldn&rsquo;t get rid of.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t let people be reasonable, and when he saw the enemy&rsquo;s injury to the ground, the demon law couldn&rsquo;t be trapped in himself.</p>
<p>Take the momentum, wait for the sword to fall, kill the demon road, and then save the six boys.</p>
<p>The demon&rsquo;s bones were broken, although it was painful, and there was still a evil method.</p>
<p>I was struggling to get up, and when I saw Fengzi in front of me, I had to stab the sword, and I couldn&rsquo;t wait to make the steel teeth in the mouth wrong, and used the most vicious evil method in the critical emergency in his own door.</p>
<p>It was the red fire flying to Fengzi&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>When Fengzi saw the Demon Tao, he suddenly stood up and did not faint.</p>
<p>As soon as he was wondering, he saw a fire flying.</p>
<p>Two times, the momentum was sick, couldn&rsquo;t hold his feet, and couldn&rsquo;t dodge.</p>
<p>I just shouted, &ldquo;Not good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Guang was bright in front of his eyes, and then a big thunderbolt would be hit. In a hurry, the golden snake in front of him was scratching, sparkling, and he seemed to be beaten by Dongxi on his head. It was dizzy and fell to the ground.  After a while, I woke up and looked at it. The sword still shook her hands. Lao Jinyu was standing in front of himself and stroking with those two long claws. At this time, the moon was governing, and the forests from the distance became a pile of shadow, but the Dongfang Skyrim showed a little light blue, and the sky was already clear. Looking for the demon road, I don&rsquo;t know where to go. When Fengzi knew it, it was a question and answer of the gesture with Lao Jinjin. Suddenly, a golden light was rushed from the forest in front. The light and shadow seemed to be shrouded in a group of children and flew across the road into Sichuan. In the blink of an eye, I did not enter the clouds, and there was no trace. Although Fengzi did not know the existence of the demon road, he was dizzy and was not hurt by the demon. The six or seven children had a golden light cage to fly up. What? Asked Jin Yan, he shook his head. Fengzi has always been doing things thoroughly. I thought about it: &ldquo;If the Demon Dao was injured by Lei Zhen, he fainted like herself, and he would definitely escape. If you see it, would you kill him, wouldn&rsquo;t he have a harm for the world? Compared with Lao Jinyu&rsquo;s gestures, Lao Jinyu shook his head again. Fengzi didn&rsquo;t ignore it, and went to Linzhong to find the past. After a few steps, first look for the iron lame and insert it behind. Find directly to the way of the demon road, see that the smoke in the stone furnace has dispersed, and the seven stone pillars are all broken. How can there be a figure? When Fengzi saw that the Shi Dan furnace was still intact, he was afraid that the demon had not died. He came back in the future, and used it to harm people, and he started his sword and was chaotic all the way. The rise of 身, pulled out the iron behind him again, a sword of the sword, the stone Mars flew, and it became a gravel instantly. Looking up, full of Xiaxiaqi, Shuguang Yaocan, the sky is clear. Looking back at Lao Jinyu, he was squatting on a jujube tree, holding a jujube, grinning, looking at him and laughing.  Feng Zigang said, &quot;</p>
<p>What do you laugh at your old mother monkey?&rdquo; Suddenly, there was a flash of shining on the side of the stone pile. Looking forward to it, it is a three -inch octagonal bronze mirror. The shade is facing the sky. There are many dragons, snake ghosts, ghost charm, black beasts, and fishes. There is also a new form in the center, which is very elegant. At the same time, Lao Jinyu also flew down from the tree, stretched out his arms to take, and cleared his hands with both hands, slowly slowing his hands, just changed it, and was picked up in his hand by Fengzi. Looking over and looking at the mirror&rsquo;s sun, I felt a cold light shot on her face. I couldn&rsquo;t help but hit a cold war, knowing that it was a treasure mirror. There are also other treasures, looking for it, and looking for a mirror pocket in the whereabouts of the dead road. Nothing else. From the thoughts, the mirror poured the mirror pork into the arms and walked into the circuit. Although the old Jinya didn&rsquo;t want to look at the bronze mirror with Fengzi, his face was full of envy.  The incident is over, and the return journey is fast. Lao Jin&rsquo;s feet are faster, and the early running forward is far ahead, and it will not be a shadow in a while. Fengzi walked away from the cave where he lived last night. Yun had reported the letter from the husband and wife and his wife and his wife and welcomed it. It turned out that since he left last night, he hasn&rsquo;t returned for a long time, and Yun has been very anxious from the master and servant. The wife of Xiao San&rsquo;er said that his mother was very sensitive. This time, it was not better than saving the daughter -in -law, which was poisoned by the demon. The absent master&rsquo;s words have been fulfilled, and it is not harmful. It has never come back, and wants to save people on the camera, it will not be harmed by the demon. Yun Cong was still suspicious of the letter, and the sword was not in his hands, and it was useless to go. After Tianming, he decided to take a risk to explore. It was precisely the old Jin Yan first, saying that it was unable to persuade Fengzi, so he had to avoid it alone, so as not to return to the same. Later, Fengzi and Demon Tao started, and it secretly spicit in the distance. Seeing the danger of Fengzi, he suddenly spread out, knocked the monster road, followed, and wanted to take the demon. He was happy for him, and saw the red light flashed, and hit a big thunder in emptiness. When the demon flies, it turned into a dark smoke, screamed, and escaped. At the same time, behind the side of the mountains and stones, a golden light flew into the place where the way of the demon was. First of all, there are also the same party, dare not approach. After a while, I didn&rsquo;t see the movement before walking. I just rescued Fengzi, and the previous golden light flew back twice, and took a few children to rush away. I realized that the golden light was the opponent of the demon road, and six children had been rescued. Fengzi also thought of watching a whereabouts in the forest, and it also went to pick jujube in the forest by the way. Zhengxiao Fengzi took a useless Shi Dan furnace to cut off and picked it up, but spent his effort, but was picked up by Fengzi&rsquo;s treasure mirror.  From listening to Xiao San&rsquo;er over the words, he couldn&rsquo;t take care of jujube. He quickly met with the holes together, met each other, and talked about it. From the perspective of the bronze mirror, Yun was really simple and elegant, shining cold, and cold air. Seeing the ancient Zhong Dingwen engraved on the handle, it was identifying. Fengzi looked at the ground and suddenly shocked &quot;</p>
<p>snoring&rdquo;. Xiao San&rsquo;er and the golden mother -in -law also surrounded each other, squatting and watching the ground together. Yun Cong asked why. Fengzi answered busyly: &quot;</p>
<p>Brother&rsquo;s hand is not moving first, you see the things under this place.&rdquo; From looking down, the mirror light could be deeper through the ground, the higher the hand, and the bigger the place you took. Essence Where the mirror light is shown, no matter the mountains and the sand, there is no obstruction. The insects in the deep soil, layer of layers, like a fish in water, walking through the ground. If there is a tree, the root of the trees is like the hanging, thousands of bears, one by one. The big family Juebao mirror is amazing, and is overjoyed. Fengzi likes it even more, and takes it back, take photos in the east, shines in the west, and love cannot be relieved. It wasn&rsquo;t until Yuncong&rsquo;s mother -in -law went to the beast group without going to the beast. Give the treasure mirror to Yun from holding, move the bags out of the cave, everyone enters the food, packs up, and prepares to go to the road. Yun has been playing for a while, and never recognized several ancient sakes on the mirror. Because Xiao San&rsquo;er couldn&rsquo;t follow at the time, he was sad, so he hid the mirror and Fengzi in his arms. When Emei saw Master, he asked the calendar.  The two master and servants sat on the rocks and diligently farewell. After half an hour, the golden mother and daughter can turn around. He deliberately folded some branches and leaves, edited a basket, picked a full pocket, and asked Yun to take it from the road to the road. It is said that the future vector industry is almost over, please go on the road. Yun Cong and Fengzi thanked the mother and daughter to help the virtue of each other. They still flew over the cliff last night and worn out of the rocks. Sure enough, the beast industry under the mountain has passed, the morning light is like Mu, and the scenery is clear. At present, the three beasts and two beasts, they have a promising future, and they have golden mothers and daughters. They are neither lost, nor are they afraid of poisonous snakes and beasts. When I walked at noon, I finished the mountain. Not far ahead, you have to transfer to the place where there are people, and the golden mother -in -law is inconvenient to send it forward. Yun Cong and Fengzi took out the food. Everyone had a meal again, and we treasured each other with Xiaosan. After ordering each other, they would break up.  Yun had walked out of the long distance and looked back from time to time. Three couples and daughters of the younger three were still waving at the top of the mountain. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao San&rsquo;er grew up together since childhood, and repeatedly suffered difficulties. Although he is a master and servant, you need to say if you are a friend. Emei, when I met the immortal master, after the Different Tao, I wonder if they can do it? &ldquo;I only thought about contemplation, and suddenly saw that Fengzi took out the treasure mirror again, and took the picture, and the surprise was shown. Yun Cong was also young and curious, and he came to take a look. Most of the seeing was almost the same as what he saw, and there was nothing particularly surprising. When I walked at dusk, I saw that there was a person ahead. Yun never slept well because he had not slept for a while, especially last night, he had no sleep all night. That family was originally a mountain people.
In the early morning of the second day, the two asked the way, and they got up and walked up.</p>
<p>Through Pingshan the next day, closer to Emei.</p>
<p>The two were greedy, relying on the fitness of the body, and did not go to the post -road official road to Emei, but wanted to cross the Da Liangshan branch veins by Shijiao Camp, copied Emei, Matian, Wulongba, Tianwang school field, Looking back, Huangjiao Tree and other places, crossing Dadu River, heading straight to Emei Mountain.</p>
<p>From time to time, there are some mountain towns, and there are some places in the middle that are difficult to go.</p>
<p>When it comes to Wulongba, the Dadu River is not far ahead.</p>
<p>As soon as the villagers on the field were inquiring, they learned that this road was much farther than taking the post road.</p>
<p>The two asked for a speed, and Bai Duo walked for two days.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it&rsquo;s almost reaching.</p>
<p>I hurriedly bought some food in the village and town.</p>
<p>When you cross the river, you can see that the famous Lingshan victory domain of the world has already presented the industry.</p>
<p>You can reach it every day.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the foot of the mountain that night, I first found a person&rsquo;s accommodation and fast.</p>
<p>The next day was unknown, so he got up and walked into the mountains.</p>
<p>The deeper into the mountains, the more we feel the majesty and great, and the momentum is imposing.</p>
<p>Yuncong and Fengzi Yuanzhao&rsquo;s ruthless fire Zhang Sangu said, followed the Mountains of Emei, all of which were all mountain cliffs, and the mountains were deep.</p>
<p>When I heard the sound of the tiger howling, the cluster grass was exhausted, the forest was like a scene, and the scenery was extremely quiet.</p>
<p>It is said that it is usually rare, and there is no trail.</p>
<p>Although the road is dangerous, because the volunteers will be reached, it will bypass the foot of Gushang Lingshan tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Coupled with the late autumn, there are Fenglin ancient pine everywhere.</p>
<p>I just feel that my heart is refreshed and happy, and I want to get the words tired.</p>
<p>Because of that treasure mirror that can be shown in the heavy spring, the bottom of the candle is taken, and after walking for a while, take it out and take photos.</p>
<p>He hopes to find the strange scenery of the treasures contained in the ground.</p>
<p>On the first two days, because Yun remembered the Monk and Wei Chihuo, the more, the deep, the deep mountains, the ancient caves of the rock, and the more heterosexuality, the more hesitant and heterogeneous, warned Fengzi to show off, in order to prevent foreigners.</p>
<p>Feng Zi&rsquo;s childlike heart did not retreat, although he couldn&rsquo;t bear it, after all, there was still a little heart.</p>
<p>As soon as I entered Emei, I thought that Xianfu was close, and there was a strange person.</p>
<p>Besides, some signs are not seen in the heart, so they are not attentive.</p>
<p>According to observations for several days, the mirror shot did not seem to be deep on the stone field, and it rarely saw something in the stone.</p>
<p>The more you follow the sediment, not only deep, but also clearly, no matter what insect viper python is lurking under the ground, it is clear and clear.</p>
<p>When encountering this kind of soil, Fengzi never let go.</p>
<p>Yun Cong was curious about the same teenager, and also had too many wonderful scenes, and gradually looked greedy.</p>
<p>The two were walking and shown all the way to the mountains, climbing the vine, and the approaching dusk, and did not feel that they did not feel that they arrived at the foot of Gushang Ling Mountain on the side of the mountain side of Emei.</p>
<p>Originally, I wanted to catch another way, suddenly there was a strong wind, flying sand, dust, and some raindrops splitting.</p>
<p>Fengzi glanced at the mountains and the sun, and the mountains were glory.</p>
<p>It was discussed with Yun.</p>
<p>Because he first entered Xianfu to meet the teacher, he needed to be cleaned up.</p>
<p>He was afraid that he would be wet and wet clothes.</p>
<p>Then he said that the mountain road was rugged, the rain was dark, and it was not easy to walk.</p>
<p>After a few steps, although the rain did not fall, the style was getting bigger and bigger.</p>
<p>The clouds of one or two were in the clouds.</p>
<p>The rain is about to fall, and he can&rsquo;t find the place where he is in his body.</p>
<p>Yun&rsquo;s abdominal pain is painful.</p>
<p>When there is a cluster of dwarf trees on the side of the road, it will be convenient to walk in.</p>
<p>I saw a large stone with a height of five or six feet high and three feet wide in the bushes, and it was close to the rocks on the one hand.</p>
<p>There is no look at the stone in the heart.</p>
<p>There is only a ruler in the gap between the gap.</p>
<p>The rock&rsquo;s top protruding up, the rock&rsquo;s foot seemed to have a black shadow in a few square meters, looking down on the dark.</p>
<p>Pick up a stone and throw it at the dark shadow, as if the dark shadow is a small cave, listening to the sound of the stones through the sound of the landing.</p>
<p>Even if it is a cave, it is so low and difficult to live.</p>
<p>After solving his hand, he stood up.</p>
<p>As soon as he walked out of the bush, the heavy rain point of the projectile flew down.</p>
<p>Thinking of what Shi Shi saw that, although the rock was low, it was carrying the rain and could be avoided temporarily.</p>
<p>Hurry up the wind, carried the bag, and ran behind Dashi.</p>
<p>And happy to return to fast, the body is not very wet.</p>
<p>The rain was shot oblique again, and the terrain was inclined.</p>
<p>Although the rain was heavy, the big stone in front of them was not wet.</p>
<p>After the two were settled, the sound of the trees was like a wave of the trees, and the sound of the tree was like a wave.</p>
<p>, I have nowhere to stay tonight, and I am worrying.</p>
<p>Fengzi took out the treasure mirror again and shined in the rock seam.</p>
<p>Yun Fang also remembers that there is a cave here.</p>
<p>With the shots of the mirror, the wall is full of moss, and there is no cave.</p>
<p>There is a large plate of ancient vines in the stone seam.</p>
<p>From the ground to the rock wall from the ground, the branches and leaves are very lush.</p>
<p>Fengzi was shining on the rattan with a mirror, and suddenly he lost his voice: &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a hole here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, the vine lifted half of the side, and it turned out that there was a three or four -foot -sized holes in the rock wall. The ancient vine happened to cover it tightly, and it couldn&rsquo;t be seen anymore. Fengzi was about to break the plate of vines, Yun Ziyun quickly blocked: &ldquo;This plate of old vine sealed the hole so tightly. Except for snakes and insects, there are usually no beasts. In the end, we also have a layer of protection. We have a good years of creature, but it is a good creature? &quot;</p>
<p>When Fengzi heard the words, he held a mirror with one hand, holding a hoe, picked the half vine, and bowed his head on the side. At first I thought that the cave was too low, and even if I could barely live, I couldn&rsquo;t stand up. In the cave, there was a picture in the cave, and there was one or two feet wide, and the lowest point was Xu Xu, which was enough to accommodate people. Although Lei was unsatisfactory, it was very clean, and there was no insectic snake. I was busy inviting to enter the inside and read it carefully. Select a relatively flat stone ground between the corners of the cavity, spread out the bag, and order a wax at the back of the stone wall.  After sitting on his knees, he talked for a while, Yun Congxue thirsty, and the water took the water, but it was empty. Fengzi will go out. Yun Cong said: &ldquo;It is dark and rainy outside, and patience is for a while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fengzi replied: &ldquo;I am a little thirsty. Anyway, I wear a worn -out clothes. When I arrived in Xianfu tomorrow, can I still put this dirty. The clothes are brought in? &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he picked up the water can, held the mirror, lifted the vine, and walked out. After a while, most of the rainwater came in, and shouted the rain in the mouth, and his body was soaked. Yun Cong said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go, don&rsquo;t you go, you are going to go, why is this bitter? Come on the clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fengzi said: &ldquo;This rain is really big. I because it is biased, the rain on the leaves is I was afraid that I was not clean. I specially chose a open space and put the can. I took it myself. However, I stood on the cliff without the rain. I didn&rsquo;t wait in the rain, so I would get so wet. &quot;</p>
<p>When he said, he was changing his clothes. He saw the two yellow lights outside from the vine seam, as if it was similar to the enemy when he saw the enemy in the enemy that day and the little demon Dao He Xing, and moved suddenly. Busy Chaoyun shook his hands from one hand, blowing out the wax at the wall, pulling out the wall, pulling the back of the back, lying the acupoint, and listening to the movement outside. From knowing that there was a police officer, he was busy putting the sword out of the sheath, keeping it in his hand, and quietly covering the acupuncture point. Looking out from the seam of the rattan, I saw two or three yellow light in front of the big stone in front of the cave. Because there is that big stone blocked, the hidden time is now, and the real number is not estimated. There are more than one or two people who calculate the people. The emotional Fengzi was able to get out of the rain, showing a little bit of traces, and was found chasing. Thinking of He Xing, the sword of the crowlin village on that day, it was lucky. There are more than one enemy tonight, and in the night of the night, things are more dangerous. The enemy has not found the cave hidden in the back of the vine, and the yellow light shines on the vine several times. I am afraid that the wind will take the liberty, and repeatedly attach the ears and lowly, and do not find the enemy to find in front of it. Do not do it. But I hope he can&rsquo;t find it, and it will be better to retreat automatically. After a while, the Huang Guang still did not retreat, just flying around the dwarf around the stone, and the ups and downs were uncertain. There was about an hour, and suddenly it fell on that stone at the same time.  At this time, the wind and rain had gradually stopped, and Huang Guang converged. There were two old and three priests, and they all sat out of the face. They could only see the back. One of the sitting in the middle: &ldquo;I clearly see the treasures of the treasure, and it is by no means a flying sword used in the same way. How can I not see the place where it hides. I want to have a long time for a long time. Since the show is revealed, it will be born away from the soil. Here is close to the enemy&rsquo;s nest, and enemies often come and go in the air. Do not let it go. , Pay attention to the movement. The appearance of that thing will be before and after dawn. I go back to the hole, finish my homework, and bring you two nephews here. Everyone is looking for it. The spells were made into a man of Xu Xiangu, and then went to Caolin Village with your master and apprentice to seek the fundamental plan. &quot;</p>
<p>When the two heard the priest talk about the crowlin village in the back cave, the two thought: &ldquo;When he came through the crowlin village sword, He Xing, he listened to Xiang Yi. . Little Demon Master&rsquo;s surname You, took him a apprentice Yunyou without returning a few days ago, but did not want to meet here. I just spoke a demon. Zi took the treasure mirror in the thunderstorm and was found to be followed by him. It was wrong as a treasure that was hidden underground. How can I go out? At this time, the sky has not been clear, or it will not be sought by him. After Tianyi Ming, go to the demon path to bring the same party. At that time If you discover this hole, you will be searched sooner or later, how can it be good? &quot;</p>
<p>Fang was anxious, and listened to the demon and apprentice outside the cave.</p>
<p>From the conversation, the demon path was actually an Emei enemy.</p>
<p>Because of the illness in the decent, I couldn&rsquo;t live, passing the crowlin village, seeing the deserted terrain and stupid mountain people, they used the demon method to calm down the mountain chiefs, and planned to make them in the village.</p>
<p>Being a nest.</p>
<p>First set the foundation, while taking the boy&rsquo;s sex and women, and secretly sacrificing the magic method in order to prepare for the future to find revenge.</p>
<p>This time I came out to convene party feathers, met a demon path of Li, who was named Li, and was subject to the Taoist Tao of the name of Xu.</p>
<p>After the Gongbi Crown, I was facing the Emperor Ningbi Cliff.</p>
<p>Help each other.</p>
<p>After many days, there are six or seven days, and the demon method can be made.</p>
<p>At night, the mountain was overlooking, and suddenly there was a blue light in the big thunderstorms under the mountain, fighting with thunder and lightning, flashed and flickering, and her treasure rushed into Xiaohan.</p>
<p>I quickly came to find it for a while, and I didn&rsquo;t find it.</p>
<p>I was afraid that I picked up the cheap for Emei Gate.</p>
<p>The intention of Tianming will excavate the entire bank on the left.</p>
<p>If you do n’t see it again, you will order the party in turn to search in turn, and you will not get away.</p>
<p>As soon as Fengzi heard it, I thought to himself: &ldquo;If you consume this way, you will be found by the demon way in the morning and evening. With his hand, how to fight with him while the monster is gathered, he has to run away with him. When the crowlin village cuts the little demon road, the whole fight is fast. This time, one person is added, and it must be unwilling to succeed. &quot;</p>
<p>The idea was good, because it was close to the demon road, and I was noticed, so I quietly pulled the clouds and pulled the clouds quietly. From a moment, gently moved to the depths of the cave, and said with ears. Yun Congzhuan was timid and heavy, and repeatedly ordered Fengzi to pay attention to caution. As soon as I heard the words of the monster and apprentice, I knew that the way to give birth was absolutely bound; once again, when I heard the idea of ​​Fengzi, although it was unstable, don&rsquo;t think of it: you have to agree. Fengzi was likely to risk the danger. When he heard the pain, he agreed, and the courage increased greatly. After interjorizing the iron pupa, I tried it and felt it. He and Yun Cong told a few words, hiding the treasure mirror in the corner of the cave, and walked towards the entrance of the cave. After the vine called, &ldquo;Two immortals outside the cave, can the villain be seen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The master and apprentice of the demon were talking vigorously. Suddenly, someone in the rock wall spoke to them and was surprised. Let&rsquo;s go down the rocks, go back and drink, &ldquo;You are a person or a weird? To tell the truth from as soon as possible, lest the real person do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fengzi replied: &ldquo;The villain&rsquo;s surname is a Guizhou, and he loves martial arts since he was a child. Because he was in his hometown. Forced by a wicked man and escaped. Listening to people talk about the mountains in the mountains, I want to ask the immortal to accept it as an apprentice, learn the fairy method, and go home to take revenge. After passing this place, I saw an octagonal glory in the forest, and the mountains were bright. First, I thought it was a monster, and I dare not approach. Later, I guess it was a baby, but I was looking for it. For a few days, although I saw the baby buried, I couldn&rsquo;t get it. I waited for it to come out a few times and did not catch it. I slept for a while, woke up to hear the immortal speak outside, and the villain knew that he was not blessed. , I do n’t deserve the baby, I just ask the immortal to accept me as an apprentice, so I will tell the treasure of the baby. Can you be optimistic about the fairy? &quot;</p>
<p>The demon Dao is Ji Taizhen what Xiang Yi said. Wen Yan was greedy, and then he ordered Fengzi to meet. Fengzi broke the vine while taking advantage of it, lifted it aside, and knelt down to the demon road. The Demon Dao ordered him to take a look. Although he was born in heroes, he did not seem to have learned the transliteration of swordsmanship. Look at Fengzi again, the bones are very powerful, the endowment is very thick, the more you are more happy. He ordered the treasure of treasure. Fengzi immediately changed his mouth to call the immortal master, and he had a gift of worship. I met a gift to the little demon again. He got up and pointed at the big stone sitting in the demon road and said, &ldquo;After the disciples guarded for two days, they saw that when the baby fled, he always disappeared under the stone. At this time, Li Dao was faint, and when he saw that Fengzi was full of his face, he completely believed in truth. First point to the little demon: &quot;</p>
<p>This is your brother Zhen Qing. You two stood aside, wait for our way to move the stone to see that the treasure was not underground?&rdquo; In the eyes, there is a word in your mouth, and the hand fingers, the big stone with tens of thousands of pounds, is automatically removed from several feet. Fengzi originally thought that the master and apprentice of the demon pushed the stone with himself, and he did not intentionally, and according to the scheduled secret sign, he would kill the small one. At the same time, Yun also came out of the entrance of the cave and gave the monster a sword. I don&rsquo;t want the demon method to be powerful, and without manpower, I moved away the big stone. When I regretted the deeds of the monster, I did not start, and missed the opportunity, and I was startled. It is also the end of the monster. After moving to Dashi, there was no trace of treasure, thinking that he hid the ground, and he ordered Fengzi to point out where the treasure hidden. Fengzi just pointed at one place. Because of this strange treasure, the demon must be hidden in the depths of the ground. Then he ordered the little demon road and Fengzi to stand in front of him, staring at the place where Fengzi pointed, his back to the mountain rock, sitting on his knees, closing his eyes and closing his eyes. The black smoke with ten fingers went straight to the ground.  At first sight, Fengzi also moved his fingers, secretly: &quot;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t start, when will you wait?&rdquo; He thought about it, secretly transporting his whole body forces on his right arm, moved his feet gently, and reached the little demon. Behind the way. With a dry cough, the right hand just pulled out the iron lattice behind him, and beaten towards the head of the little demon. The opposite demon road suddenly blame his eyes, and when he saw Fengzi raised his head on the little demon, he knew that Fengzi was not kind. Drink: &quot;</p>
<p>Good karma!&rdquo; In his hand, a yellow light flew out his hand. The little monster was doing the law, listening to a dry cough, the wind behind his head, knowing someone to calculate. I was about to get up, and I was scolded by the demon. I thought I had any faults. I was slightly sparse, and it was slightly slow. The brain was cracked and died of a fate. At this time, Fengzi had seen the Dao Dao noticed, and Huang Guang flew on his face and knew it was not good. In a hurry, he grabbed the body of the little monster&rsquo;s fall and fell without falling, hitting the demon path, and padded with his feet. Suddenly, when I saw the opposite Huang Guangying, a group of things flew on the ground, and the bones rolled down under the hillside. Yun Cong also followed, raising his sword straight towards the yellow light. As soon as the demon died, Fei Jian lost his control, rotated in the air alone, and was stunned by the cloud from the moment, and he fell to the ground. Picking up, there are runes engraved on it, which is similar to the small demon Dao Dao Ho Xing killed by Caolin Village, but the crystal light, but the sword is much stronger. Just search the monster&rsquo;s side, looking for a sword box in the waist, and a pocket. Suddenly, he didn&rsquo;t care about what he hidden in the middle of the middle, so he handed the sword and pocket to Fengzi. In a hurry, I took the bag of treasure mirror, so I had to avoid the danger overnight. Fengzi was busy stopping: &quot;</p>
<p>Although the master and apprentice died, there was still the monster road last night than these two. They could fly with the demon method. Still running off. Mo Ru, while Tianming was still early, hid the demon corpse body, deliberately made the demon road concealment, swallowed the baby to escape, so as not to follow him to chase, wouldn&rsquo;t it be good? &quot; The son is smarter than the day in recent days. At the moment, the first level and corpse of the monster and apprentice of the demon Taoist and apprentices were thrown into the deep. With the sword, all the mud and mountain stones where the blood stains were mixed and mixed, and a three -four -foot deep pit was dug at the place where the original magnifying stone.  Everything is almost done. Looking at the stars in the sky, it is not a long time to know Li Tianming. And the way to go to the back of the demon road, there is no need to bypass, just hope that he will not be caught up by him, so it may be as good. After walking, there was an hour, and the sky became clear. The two drove away for another journey. Before seeing any movements behind, they slightly put the snacks. I was exhausted in the middle of the night, and walked a lot of mountain roads in a hurry, feeling a little lacking hunger. After the rain, the mud was muddy, the clothes were dirty, and at a glance, there was a lot of blood splash. After choosing a secluded place, the clothes were replaced with a new one, and the old clothes were lost. Then each person entered some diet, finished eating, and planned to rest slightly. So he talked about the passing of the demon just now.
It turned out that Fengzi agreed with Yun Cong when he was in the cave.</p>
<p>He only heard that Fengzi coughed outside, and Yun Congsia started from the cave.</p>
<p>At that time, the Demon Dao was closing his eyes.</p>
<p>When he heard that the cough was different, he opened his eyes and saw that when Fengzi was about to hit his apprentice, he couldn&rsquo;t help but be furious.</p>
<p>To take the first level of Fengzi.</p>
<p>Who knew that there was something wrong in the busyness, he sang, but was misunderstood by his apprentice, and he was killed by the wind.</p>
<p>The Demon Dao was angrily attacked, and Quan God noted the enemy in front of him, but unexpectedly, he also fired a rival.</p>
<p>Yun came out of a long snake from the back hole and rushed out.</p>
<p>Seeing that Huang Guangye has flew towards Fengzi, at the same time, he saw the little demon Dao flying from the beside Fengzi.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s slower.</p>
<p>When I came out, I was too anxious, and I had not been far behind the demon.</p>
<p>I was busy changing the sword in my hand to change the movement of the clouds and fog, sideways with a sword, and waved towards the demon&rsquo;s head on my wrist.</p>
<p>How sharp the fairy sword is?</p>
<p>From a sword, Yun turned his left shoulder, turned towards a tweeter on the right, and the sword was passing forward.</p>
<p>At that time, it happened that it happened, otherwise the demon road was alertly alert beforehand, or the two were slightly slower, and one would also want to live.</p>
<p>Speaking afterwards, Yun Cong was still shocked, and he was lucky.</p>
<p>Because of seeing Fengzi want to take the pockets from the demon, see what is in the inside, Yun Zhi stopped: &ldquo;At this time, although the enemy had not found chasing, he always took care of it before he arrived. If it wasn&rsquo;t for you to take a treasure mirror last night, there would be this chaos? Take it out to avoid things to avoid things. &quot;</p>
<p>Fengzi had to stop.  Because Xianfu is about to arrive, there are many things that are not tight, so they pack up the two bags from newly packed them, and they will use clothes in the future. Although the rest are still carrying, they are ready to throw away. The pocket of the demon road was originally stuffed inside the bag. When they packed them, they were busy, and they were unintentionally stunned by the wind. At that time, they didn&rsquo;t notice it at that time. Moji Zhang Sangu said in the way to go to the cave after going to Xianfu, and calculated that before the sunset on the day of the day, if there was no obstruction, he could reach Xianfu.  The deeper into the mountains, the more quiet and more beautiful, the more dangerous. The two saw that the sky was clear, the white clouds were like a belt, and the mountainside was around, and the left was near the mountains. Coupled with the fairy spirit, after many days of hard work, seeing the wishes, the more advanced, the more prosperous. There was nothing all the way, and gradually forgot to worry. Who knows that the joy is very sad, the disaster is in front of each other, and some of them do not know. The way of the scriptures is a mountain beam, which needs to be over. Before walking on the mountain beam, walking through a forest, he was about to wear the forest, and he heard that there was a voicing sound on the top of his head. The two looked up from the tree gap to look up. In the sun, they seemed to see two light yellow stars flying passing by, and they flew back again for a while. The two saw such abnormalities at this time. Although I felt a little surprised in my care, I was still busy with my feet, and I didn&rsquo;t stop. When I walked out of the forest, there was a few steps forward. The cloud and Fengzi thought of what I encountered at the same time at the same time. This was doubtful that it was chasing the enemy and looking for myself in the air. When he hid himself quickly, the two yellow light in the air suddenly flashed in one place, flashed, and Luffy fell on the left side. When you have half a cup of tea, when you see without movement, you will still walk forward. As soon as I crossed the mountain beams, when I went downhill, I suddenly listened to the sound of breaking the sky in the sky. Looking back, the light became stronger, and a cyan yellow one was added. According to the direction of the two people, the illness came from the meteor. In addition to short weeds, I can&rsquo;t find the hiding place. From because of the invisibleness, the people came from the Gao to observe easily. They could not escape the attention of the people. Do you panic yourself, don&rsquo;t you reveal your horses? Then he whispered that Fengzi pretended not to know, and hurried as usual. Fengzi had no cloud from fear, and heard the words and replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s blessing, it&rsquo;s not a disaster, but a misfortune. He has seen him about it. What about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between the words, there were two yellow light chasing the two people in front of Xu Yuan and near, and the two children dressed up. One of the older inner, as soon as it landed, stopped up and asked, &ldquo;Where are the two of you? What do you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What? Isn&rsquo;t this little black ghost beside Uncle You&rsquo;s magic sac? Don&rsquo;t catch him to see Master? &ldquo;Fengzi Xianshi saw two children&rsquo;s roads asking for a question. Holding the handle of the sword earlier last night, I was going to use my words to Zhi. I was slightly wrong. I still gave him a strong start. As soon as I heard that I was used to be seen by Tao Tong behind, it was seen that it was a demon. I knew that the Tibetan revealed was unavoidable except for a fight. Don&rsquo;t wait for Dao Tong to finish speaking, Dark Yunyun passed a look at it, and he didn&rsquo;t say anything. He waved his left shoulder and threw his back to the backpack. A Taoist child is a puppet. This time, the enemy is no more than two times before, and the enemy means. The child&rsquo;s ability is far above the small demon of the Demon Dao of the Caolin Village. Where can it be hit? When the child saw Fengzi hit, he scolded in his mouth: &quot;</p>
<p>Karma!&rdquo; A little bit, lifted up, his right hand tactical, chanting in his mouth, and stretching his left hand to pat the sword around the waist. Flying will hurt people. Unexpectedly, Fengzi had a good idea of ​​dual materials, and his left hand was hit out, and his right hand still held the hilt that was slanted behind him. Seeing the enemy&rsquo;s method very fast, escape the cricket, busy putting his right hand with force, following the momentum of the sword behind him, to the left side, and against the wrist, the trick to divide the flowers, the sword, the sword, the sword, the sword, the sword, The tip rolled up from the left below. After changing the tricks of apes, the enemy avoided the enemy and cut off. That Tong Wan didn&rsquo;t expect to hold a sword on his right hand, and his skills were so fast, and shouted: &quot;</p>
<p>No!&rdquo; He quickly shrunk his shoulders and fell back and planned to avoid the sword Feng Feng. Let&rsquo;s release the sword again. I only felt that the tip of the right hand was cold, and the right hand had been stuck a little by the sword of the wind, cut off two and a half fingers, and suddenly felt pain. Fengzi was waiting to catch up. Suddenly, Huang Guang flashed, and the Taoist child behind had released the flying sword, and he was about to get on his head. He didn&rsquo;t dare to neglect. One in the air, one underground, fighting endlessly. Fortunately, the enemy&rsquo;s swordsmanship is not high, and the sword has not yet been practiced. Qiao Fengzi got the good sword again last night. At the moment, Fengzi Single played against the first Taoism, and both moved both.  Yun Cong saw Fengzi his eyes, knowing that he was going to launch, just pulled the sword out, and Fengzi had played against the people. When a Taoist child was injured and retreated, the latter Taoism hated gritting his teeth and setting his feet. Zheng Yuyun arrived from flying and welcomed him. Two or two, one in one, fight one by one. These two Taoist children came from the door. Soon after getting started, although the swordsmanship was not high, he learned a demon evil. Because of hate wind cut bones, at first sight, the enemy would not fly swords. Only each person had a sword light, which had stumbled to the enemy with a sword. I think the two of them shouldn&rsquo;t be absent, and the two Taoism children just said each other: &quot;</p>
<p>These two karma are very abominable! We use magic weapon spells to catch them, crush the corpses, and take revenge to the uncle and brother!&rdquo; Yun From the time of hearing, the heart was busy, and one of the hillsides on the side of the side said, &quot;</p>
<p>Tules, don&rsquo;t do so. These two karma are quite qualified. Turn back to Xianmen to practice, and I will not blame the past. Otherwise, you can take them with the real skills to capture them, bring back the cave, and get revenge from your uncle. &quot; Dao Tong knew that Master had the meaning of love, implying that he was captured, and he was not allowed to hurt. Although he hated and dare to violate it, he had to point to the two of them and scolded: &quot;</p>
<p>We want to kill your two karma, without any effort. , Rwnn you the two of you, otherwise you still have to break your two corpse for thousands of corpses. Hurry back to avoid yourself! &quot;  Yun Cong, Fengzi and the air in the air were fighting. When he heard someone spoke, he was the master of the two children. Hundreds of busy stolen eyes to look at the hillside. On a mountain stone, a Taoist who was sitting in yellow grass, wearing Jiuliang Dao crowns, and slanting several small forks. No wonder that Shi Cai saw the three yellow light in the air, and only two people fell. The man looked at it in a hurry, as if he had an ugly face, and his speaking accent was the same as the demon path last night. The two apprentices are already so powerful, and the monster -doctrine is not known. I am under the door of the fairy. Yun Cong remembered the immortal of Zhang Sangu, although there was danger, it was not a big deal. In an emergency, Ding and Wild Lingling were besieged by thousands of beasts, and suddenly they came to savior. Now that the demon has the meaning of love and talent, the apprentice is not allowed to hurt people secretly with evil law. Therefore, I did n’t answer the words, but I just fight hard. Since Suo Yunzi went to Emei this time, he could use the use of illness and danger. At this time, he was dumbfounded. Under the door of Ningbi Ya Da Cave Emei fairy, how can you be an apprentice of your demon and demon? You know the law, and the little grandfather can still fairy! Other than, otherwise, when I was young, my master and uncle were more immortal. Seeing that your little grandfather did not go back, he found the clouds and caught the three demon roads of your young and old back to the mountain. People are harmed. &quot;</p>
<p>Feng Zi said madness, and he hid there again.</p>
<p>When he first moved, it was originally used by swords and 镧.</p>
<p>As soon as the enemy&rsquo;s sword light flew out, he knew that the iron pupae went up and broke.</p>
<p>The sword held in the hands and the air sword in the air struggle.</p>
<p>Urgent the enemy is too late.</p>
<p>Where can I use iron?</p>
<p>It is not only useless to hold it in your hand, but there are some burdens; if you throw it to the ground, it is a pity that the enemy will go.</p>
<p>There is no idea.</p>
<p>I thought: &ldquo;There are only two of them, but the enemy is three. The most powerful one has not yet started. The capture of the thief must capture the king, why not take care of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the past, the wind was originally opened to the side to prepare for a slow breath. The enemy also directed Huang Guang to chase with it. This time Fengzi spelling strange risks, not only does not avoid the vertical backward, but instead unexpectedly, between two times and one grid, pumping the sword, buried his head, protecting the top of his head, using the power of the whole body, using the whole body power, and using the power of the whole body. , I have a pad under my feet, sitting at the hillside monster on the front of the hillside, there are more than ten feet away, which is really ill. The foot of the feet landed, and Tao Tong also directed Huang Guang to chase. Fengzi didn&rsquo;t start first. Once he turned around, he faced the enemy&rsquo;s flying sword first, and another way of fighting, and then traveled to the circuit twice. In this way, the industry has already been in accordance with the right, and take a little gap that cannot be sent back, and then tilted his head back, withdrawing his hand to fly towards the demon&rsquo;s head. This trick is really dangerous. When the landing back to the ground, it is not better than the first time to take a person. First listening to the sound of the loud noise, I don&rsquo;t know if I hit the demon. Before the body landed, before he stood firm, he listened to the sound of golden blades in the ears. Huang Guang came from behind his head. The enemy&rsquo;s flying sword was only a few inches from the head and neck. Fengzi shouted: &ldquo;Not good!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A busy sword danced up a sword flower and rolled on the spot, ready to avoid the solution of a milk cat play butterfly. Listening to a big drink next to my ears: &ldquo;The disciples!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child saw the enemy falling to the ground, and he was happy in his heart. He was about to direct the whereabouts of Jian Guang. stop. Fengzi had raised the sword to obliquely protect the door, followed the ground, a carp was tall, and he went out of the way to escape the risk.  It turned out that the demon road was annoyed to listen to Fengzi scolding. He also heard that Master said that Master was a drunk Taoist, and thought of only taking care of two good apprentices, and forgetting it was not far from the Emei acupoint here. Do not give up before, pay for it in vain? I love these two people&rsquo;s qualifications, and they are not willing to surrender under the door and capture them back. It is also a wonderful thing to do the main soul when they are revenge on the treasure. Fang Zai was determined that he didn&rsquo;t want Fengzi to let it go from the strange danger. The Demon Dao is not a master of the door, nor is it ordinary, how can this be hit. Seeing that the two enemies were able to hold each other in the step with the flying sword for a while, their skills were agitated, the apes were wiped out, and they ran all the way. The two apprentices did not take advantage at all. Essence I just praised: &ldquo;Emei sword is really extraordinary, and even the two newly started juniors are so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, when the enemy raised his head, he tilted his head, and he raised the same thing in his hand. Demon Dao scolded: &ldquo;Good karma! He died in the end, dare to hurt people with arrows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He made the side and let it. The power of Fengzi is big, and the 量 is deep, and it uses 20 % of the strength. Although the 镧 has not hit the monster, he hit a two -foot thickness behind the demon. On the sharp stalagmites. Just listening to the card, Mars splashed, the stalagmitted waist was broken, and it would fall down and fell on the back of the demon path. The Demon Dao was originally crossing hands and sitting on the sits. When I came, I knew it was an ordinary blade hidden weapon. I was too lazy to pick up with my hands. Unexpectedly, there was this stalagmice behind him. The gravel Mars splashed his head first, and then the big stalagmitted fell down and hit the demon&rsquo;s heart. If you change to ordinary people, you are afraid that you will not break the fracture and die with blood. As far as the monk is a skillful spell, because he is too light, he is too much to protect the protection. In this case, the demon road was full of anger, and he was busy with anger: &ldquo;Tules! Hurry up to capture the two karma back to the mountain to sacrifice the magic weapon, only to temporarily break their lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point, the demon road was shouting at this time, and the child thought that he would not be allowed to hurt him. It was slightly delayed. Fengzi had escaped from under the flying sword. Not mentioned.  The three masters and apprentices of the demon and apprentice were originally taken when they were described.  That demon road is the half -wind of the Yuechengling Huangshidong Flying fork. Born beside the door, there was no calculation in the early years. In the past few decades, because of being alerted by a capable person, Dumen could not be released. Unexpectedly, the apprentice caused trouble, and the new losses of the people in the Wudang faction in Luofu, and killed his loved apprentice. Knowing that the power is weak, the ability is not as good as anyone. He wanted to go to the North Sea to get the ancestor of the North Sea, and used him to use the magic weapon to revenge. Coincidentally at the top of Wuyi Mountain, Fujian, Lu Yu Wan Miao Xiangu Xu Fei Niang, talking about three times of Emei sword, there were two Yin people in the inside. Those who want to find a person who has not appeared for many years and does not pay attention to the people in the Emei faction dives to the Mountains of Emei, and sacrifice a kind of evil method to prepare for the two Yin people to remove them in advance. If you want to bother him to go, he will ask him to return to the Wutai School. Li Banfeng asked the two Yin people, and it was Sister Qin Ziling, the second daughter of Tianhu Baoxiang, who did it first to break the two daughter Yuan Yin first. It is a pity that this one of the hands of Xu Fei and many different factions can also satisfy the lust, and can also get a different treasure. At that time, he took it down, took Xu Fei Niang&rsquo;s Bao Tan spirit, and passed on the practice, and quietly took two apprentices to the place where the two apprentices went to Emei Shangu Lingfei. Fortunately, I know that the Emei faction is always good at people, and does not blame the past. As long as I do not show the traces of revenge and the abroad, the place of refining the method is deeply hidden, and there is a compliance blocking. Even if you meet the people in the Emei faction, you can tell him that he is in love with Emei Lingxiu and lives in seclusion without being interfered. When the three masters and apprentices arrived at the ground, they daily, and the laws granted in accordance with the law. In the end, as a thief, he knows that his two new disciples have a bad skills and cannot win the responsibility. Although the matter is hidden, there is also a difficult for the masters in the enemy. Want to find a party, so that you can look at the top of the mountain when you do it yourself. When you meet a policeman, a secret code can be put away in the right time. Isn&rsquo;t the enemy looking for it? Isn&rsquo;t it all? He has never been born for many years. All the same year was the same. Because of the persecution of each decent, most of them were died or fled. At first, I forgot to invite Fei Niang to represent the contract, so I had to order the two apprentices to be difficult to do it carefully.  Suddenly, I suddenly thought about it. I went to the city of Emei to find a restaurant. The road was narrow. When I went down the mountain, I met the dwarf Zhu Mei, Drunk Taoist and Master Yuan Jing. With a panic in my heart, I just secretly said, &ldquo;We are obscure! I lost my interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I wanted to return to the mountain, and I knew that the three people&rsquo;s spiritual alarm was extremely doubtful. I deliberately pretended to be drunk. Heart wine. When I returned to the mountains, I suddenly met a younger brother who hadn&rsquo;t seen each other for many years, and it was the monster of the surname. Speaking, because of the avoidance of for many years, he has been thinking about it, and he has found a good place in the people in the mountains of Caiminzhai. The place is very remote. You can also serve the mountain people to build a palace view and think that it is based on a place. The southern Xinjiang is far away, and you can enjoy happiness. The same party of the surname was applied to the surnamed door, and Dan Cheng went to the appointment in the wild Lingling. This time, I brought a beloved apprentice to Chengdu to find a craftsman. Li Banfeng heard his words, and he was inherent. First of all, I was so fascinated and waiting for people. I did n’t see any movement for a few days. Fortunately, I added an assistant. If you can hear the police, you can prepare for preparation.
Yuncong and Fengzi avoided the rain one night.</p>
<p>The mountainside was originally full of starry moon.</p>
<p>The two demon roads each took lovers to face the mountain on the hill, pretending to be idle and cheerful.</p>
<p>Suddenly, when Fengzi held the treasure mirror Guanghua, he was on the candle, and it was seen that it was not the things that the monks had sacrificed.</p>
<p>I thought that the treasure was unearthed and quickly followed the search, but did not find it.</p>
<p>Li Banfeng was busy practicing the Fa, and he didn&rsquo;t give up the treasure of Na, to prevent it for outsiders.</p>
<p>Greeting is cute, thinking that there is no one to look at this night, how can there be something wrong with this?</p>
<p>After leaving the demon master and apprentice search, he returned to the mountain to practice.</p>
<p>After Tianming, I came to see that the big stone sitting last night had been removed.</p>
<p>There was a hole between the rock walls, and the monk was disappeared.</p>
<p>It was seen that the big stone was moved by the monster method.</p>
<p>At first, it was also confused by Fengzi.</p>
<p>Two apprentices, one apprentice, one, and a Bai Zhi, both of which are very witty.</p>
<p>Wu Min said, &ldquo;Although Uncle You hasn&rsquo;t seen him for many years, others are alone, and they are thinking about it here. Master asked Master to create a foundation. He also said that he had many secrets and the fundamental places of the crowlin village. Don&rsquo;t you be afraid to find my apprentice? &quot;</p>
<p>The demon Dao didn&rsquo;t believe it first, thinking that if it was really a treasure, wouldn&rsquo;t he give up a place where he would start a business? Later, Bai Zhi suddenly picked up a magic sac, the elixir and some unpaid magic weapons inside the inside recognized as a small demon road, and there was blood stains on it. Looking at the place where the ground moved on the ground, there was no blood. First of all, I met the enemy of Emei, and then followed the footprints in the mud, and looked at the first level of the monster and apprentice corpse in the nearby mountain stream. It is a weapon for ordinary people. How can a monster and apprentice die in the hands of ordinary people? Because the corpse did not use elixir, it was known that it was not under the gate of Emei. Li Banfeng has always been hard, seeing that the demon path is dead, the practice of the demon is almost finished, and the local area is close to the nest of the enemy. Two little demon Dao is injured because the wounded is the normal weapon, and the thieves lurking in the mountains must take the damage to their unpreparedness. And the existing mortal footprints underground are evidence. No revenge, you can&rsquo;t say, insist on searching. In the end, the demon road was still holding treasures, and he did not stop it. Only instructed not to fly away from being too far away in order to prevent the enemy from seeing the enemy. If there is a suspicious person, send a letter with yourself quickly and get started. If you ask, return it first. The two little monster thought that ordinary people would never go far. After the rain, the footprints were clear all the way, and they were more likely to visit. They thought they would lurk nearby. However, it was not expected that Fengzi and Yun walked quickly from walking, and fleeing anxiously. The rain only went down the mountain again, and there were no rain in some places. The two little demon roads looked for a while, and suddenly didn&rsquo;t see their footprints. As soon as the two discussed, they drove their swords and flew into the air in the air. After a long time, he found that Yun Cong and Fengzi traveled, and went back to Li Banfeng to report to Li Banfeng.</p>
