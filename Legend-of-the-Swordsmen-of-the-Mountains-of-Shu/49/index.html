    <h1>48th round of purple electric flying mang, 木 第 山 山 山 第 第 第 第 第 第 第</h1>
    <p>48th round of purple electric flying mang, 木 第 山 山 山 第 第 第 第 第 第 第  Ying Qiong had a dozen ate, hiding those Zhu Guo in the package, preparing to eat on the road.</p>
<p>Just after cleaning up, I suddenly saw that the gorgeon came up and led Yingqiong to the bottom.</p>
<p>When Ying Qiong looked at the tree carefully, it was rooted on the stone.</p>
<p>The whole body was transparent, the tree body was red, and there were still a few drops of blood beside the tree.</p>
<p>The orangutan was compared with a while, and we cried a few times.</p>
<p>Yingqiong understood that this was a place that was harmed by monsters yesterday.</p>
<p>Kong acupoints looked very deep.</p>
<p>The old orangutan used gestures to make Yingqiong stand outside, but it climbed in.</p>
<p>As a result, Ying Qiong was the monster nest, and did not dare to care, so she pulled the purple sword in her hand and watched them with a look of attention.</p>
<p>I saw that this strange stone was about two high rounds, the posture was abrupt, the upper and lower, and the body was exquisitely exquisite.</p>
<p>The stone color was green and very beautiful.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong all the way to play and play, and after turning to the stone in my heart, I saw a two -foot -seeing area, which was engraved with the four sentences of &ldquo;Xiong Qi Zi Zi, female names of Qingo, Yingyun meet, and the gods started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word of the seal, there is a slender eyebrow underneath, without knowing. Thinking of the purple sacrifice in the waist, there was a mouth of the mouth, and a female sword was buried here. &ldquo;Ying&rdquo;</p>
<p>is his own name. Who does &ldquo;Yun&rdquo;</p>
<p>know? I couldn&rsquo;t help but get greedy, I wanted to get it together.  Looking around carefully, the old orangutan came out of the hole, carrying a orangutan on his body, and his karma was dying, and his hand was holding two things like a baby. It turned out that this hole was the place where monsters were hidden. The monster is called wooden, and the power is infinite. The two steel claws can wear golden stones, which are extremely sharp and eat the biological brain. The big tree beside the hole is the Zhu Guo passed by Taoism. Whenever people eat, fitness, and longevity. Thirty years only blossomed. The orangutan here is called the orangutan ape, which is born of the orangutan and ape monkey, which is understandable. I want to be destroyed by monsters on weekdays, as painful as the horses encountering mountains. When Ying Qiong came to the cave, the orangutan rushed to die. When she fell asleep by that monster, she took Zhu Guo and Yingqiong to eat, which caused her to take revenge. That Muya was sleeping well, especially after noon, it was even more sleepy. As soon as Yingqiong was in the second time Zhu Guo, the orangutan was very scared. He was brave and picked up before he picked up a few Zhu Guo, and he woke up the wooden cricket and flee quickly. Five. Ashamed in the past, eat the orangutan brain and throw the oranges on it. There was a orangutan in the inside stunned to the ground, could not escape, and was captured by it. When the wooden cricket was eating biological cerebral blood, he was drunk and wanted to sleep. It happened that Ying Qiong arrived, and it estimated that there was a buying and selling door, and went up, and did not want to touch it on the nail. This monster was long -lasting, and saw the purple light on Ying Qiong&rsquo;s sword. He knew it was not good, and hurriedly fled. The same kind of orangutan still has a kind of unknown, knowing that wooden crickets only eat orangutan brains and do not eat orangutan; I also know that Yingqiong loves to eat Zhu Guo and intends to use it to report to Germany. After picking Zhu Guo, he sniffed the breath of the orangutan, risked into the inside, looking for the same type, and he had been sandwiched half to death by the wooden cricket. Inadvertently found two children&rsquo;s corpses in the depths of the cave, and took it out. It turned out to be two formed He Shouwu. After taking shape, he was marched in the mountains and was seen by Muyu as a creature. After grabbing death, I feel that it is not like creatures. Namu has been able to eat blood. I do n’t know how to use this millennium spirit. She threw it in the cave and was found by the old orangutan and was enjoyed with Ying Qiong.  Most of the orangutan apes and the like are mostly loving the public. At first, I saw two children corpses and thought Yingqiong was the same. I originally planned to bring it out and see Ying Qiong. In the beginning, Ying Qiong also mistakenly recognized as a baby corpse, and when he received a look at it, he was less than a foot long. Although his eyes were good and the shape was like a person, he was different from the birth of a person. And a scent of fragrance, it was not blood that flowed out of the monster injury, but it was jade -like white pulp. Thinking of his father, Li Ning said that in the deep mountains, if you run into a villain pony, it is a thousand -year -old ganoderma lucidum and He Shouwu, and you can become immortal. These two villains, don&rsquo;t you know it or not? If it is really a spiritual matter, wouldn&rsquo;t it be lucky? And I am afraid that the things taken out in the material hole, in case of poison, are not the same. Suddenly, the gorber orangutan was standing there, and thought, &ldquo;I heard that the orangutan and the monkeys do not eat it. Eat. The old orangutan thought it was a person at first, and she dared not eat it. She couldn&rsquo;t help but press the sword to anger and scared it. She barely took a bite. After seeing the old orangutan bite, she suddenly liked it. , Lian Bai Bite, I am very happy to eat. When Ying Qiong thinks of this is a strange, it is rare to meet. When this is so bad, she has been eaten by the orangutan three mouthfuls and two mouthfuls. I ca n’t stand the saliva, and I still want to ask for a request. Ying Qiong drank: &quot;</p>
<p>I originally told you to taste a small hand, who told you to eat it? I can&rsquo;t give it to you in my hand.&rdquo; She saw the orangutan ate it There is no movement, knowing non -toxic. While saying that if you break the arm of the first Ukraine, there are many white pulp emerge. I took a busy mouth, and it turned out to be fragrant and sweet, slightly bitter with a little bit, and it became more delicious. Later, the more fragrant it was sucking, but even the meat was chewed, I realized that there was no bone of the Shouwu all over the body, and it seemed that it was much different from the potato and yellow essence in the mouth, but it was more sweet. Because I know that it is a prolonged spirit, I am afraid that it is difficult to be outdated, and the amount of food on the day is good. Fortunately, the whole body is not very heavy. At the moment, I ate it and wipe my mouth with the silk thread in my waist.  When I was still looking for the female sword, I suddenly saw a white smoke in the big stone seam. It was amazing, and suddenly listened to the orangutan who looked at it all roaring, the gorber orangutan was shocked when he boarded it, and he used his front palm to score again and again. Ying Qiongzhi was a monster turning around and dared not neglect. She danced the sword dancing a ball of purple light and her on the cliff. When the gorgeon saw Ying Qiong dancing a purple light, he did not dare to approach, and went to the cliff from the side to find a secluded place. Ying Qiong went to the high place and looked at the four outside. It was already Hong Ri Kong, nearly noon. On the northwest corner of the roadside, there are more than ten kingfishers in the big trees, and they are crying, flying to their own peaks. Under the sun, the red feathers are clear and very beautiful. After a while, crossed Fengnan and put it in a forest. In addition, there are no signs on all sides. The old orangutan also came up from a secluded place, and he looked at the orangutan who looked at it for a while. Looking back at Ying Qiong, it was referring to the forest on the northwest corner. Ying Qiong didn&rsquo;t know what it meant, and the female sword said in the stone in her heart, intended to find it again. When I walked to the side, I was about to fall down, and the white smoke emerging from the strange stone seam was unable to hold it like a dense fog. I asked the sneak in a blink of an eye, and I couldn&rsquo;t see the strange stone hidden.  Ying Qiong lived in Emei for several months, watching the fog, and knowing that such a dense fog could not be eliminated. Below is like a knife, and I do n’t know where the female sword is buried. Even if they are risky, they ca n’t find it. Monsters of the old age did not turn around, and they were a little boring. Suddenly I remembered: &quot;</p>
<p>How did this mountain have many monsters and beasts and elixir? The holes I lived last night were so bright and warm, presumably there were treasures buried. Last night, I found it. Looking for? Or it is unknown to meet. &ldquo;Ying Qiong&rsquo;s child was anxious, and when he thought of where he thought of, he led the orangutan and walked towards the hole. Since eating Ho Shouwu, it has been half an hour, and I feel that my efforts have increased greatly, my body and mind are very brisk, and I am very happy. Ti Jian walked away from the big forest on the northwest corner, only more than ten feet away, and the orangutan who was walking ahead suddenly stunned. Ying Qiong saw that two horse bears died underground, the brain was empty, and it was generally the same as the orangutan death last night. When the monster escaped, he met a horse bear and was caught by it as a morning meal. Looking at the four outside, although there was no movement, I didn&rsquo;t dare to care about it. I added a bit of carefulness and walked forward. This group of orangutans surrounded Ying Qiong, some were in front, some were behind, and some of them climbed their forefoot on the ground, and some people leaped their verticals. Among this group of beasts, it is a spectacle with a peerless red girl girl. Ying Qiong also felt that she had the ability to lower the monster and beast, and her pride was indispensable.
Just bypassing the large forest, I took a dozen steps.</p>
<p>Suddenly a orangutan screamed in the back, and then the orangutan beside him was in a chaos and fled.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong knew that Huo Di turned around and looked at the sword in front of him.</p>
<p>There were several in the gorillas fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The monsters with green eyes and long -armed bird claws in the hole acupoint next to Shi Caicai, stretched out five thin long arms like lightning, and fluttered in the air, and there was only a ruler from the top of the head.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong was shocked and had no time to avoid.</p>
<p>She was busy with the sword in her hands, more than ten feet purple light, Changhong like a shouted, and was very screaming.</p>
<p>When I was busy looking at the side, there were two dark shadows under the sun, and there was a sound of heavy objects to the ground.</p>
<p>The monster had been split from head to toe.</p>
<p>I thought that the monster came fiercely, and the dying power was over.</p>
<p>It turned out that the woodenness was like a fire.</p>
<p>Since being driven away by Ying Qiong, he knows that the enemy&rsquo;s sword light is powerful and dare not play positively.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to be seen by Feng&rsquo;s head, roar up, and when Ying Qiong came up, it had hidden into Shenlin.</p>
<p>The kingfisher that Shi Yingqiong saw Nanfei was shocked by the wooden.</p>
<p>As soon as Ying Qiong led the orangutan to turn around, it was afraid that Yingqiong&rsquo;s sword would be powerful for several times to start with a few times.</p>
<p>Waiting for Ying Qiong turned to the woods, but couldn&rsquo;t help it.</p>
<p>He originally wanted to fly behind Ying Qiong, and grabbed Yingqiong&rsquo;s brain with one claw.</p>
<p>Who knows that the orangutan behind Ying Qiong saw two dead horse bears, knowing that he was hurt by a monster, and he was already shocked and dared.</p>
<p>The beasts are the most wise, and when you see that the wooden puppet flys, it naturally screams.</p>
<p>It could not help but fire, and killed two orangutans, and his skills were delayed.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong had to hear the police, spin back, and split it with the purple sword, and was spared to avoid difficulties.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the wooden puppet will fly empty, and it will be like a floating wind.</p>
<p>If the two orangutans have been killed in the instant delay, the Yingqiong Ziyu sword can fly out automatically even if it is psychic, and I am afraid that it will inevitably be in danger.</p>
<p>Seeing that the monster was dead, Ying Qiong was happy.</p>
<p>Naturally, the orangutan was even more happy, but it was poisoned on weekdays.</p>
<p>When I saw Yingqiong a few swords, I shouted without seeing the movement.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong knew that these orangutans were deeply injured, and they were so fun to look fun and couldn&rsquo;t stop.</p>
<p>The old orangutan bite the monster for a while, and suddenly took out a piece of red and green, like jade, non -jade, and transparent things like pearls, and dedicated it to Ying Qiong.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong took a look in his hand.</p>
<p>This jade -like thing is long -lasting and dazzling.</p>
<p>Although I do n’t know the use, I feel very cute, so I put it on my body.</p>
<p>It was about to order that the gorilla led the orangutan to return to the hole.</p>
<p>When looking up, Red Ri Industry has hidden.</p>
<p>The woods on the road were blowing up like a wild wave before the rain, and the flying was uncertain.</p>
<p>The dark clouds together together together, the Jie is like a horses, the thicker the more aggregate, the sky is low to the top of the head.</p>
<p>Among the dark clouds, dozens of golden snakes are always challenging.</p>
<p>In the clouds, many changes in the wind of the Wuyun layer, like a strange stone, Dragon Bird Tower Pavilion, disappeared in an instant and very beautiful.</p>
<p>Knowing that it changes, it is necessary to rain.</p>
<p>It is common for this mountain to encounter rain.</p>
<p>However, Ying Qiong has been in Lichun Qingri even in the day.</p>
<p>Shi talent is still the sky.</p>
<p>It is expected that he does not expect that the sky will become so fast.</p>
<p>There are ten miles away from the cave here.</p>
<p>I am afraid that wrapped the body wrapped wet and not changed.</p>
<p>The orangutan said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all you want to tear the monster dead corpses and delay time. You see that the wind and rain are coming immediately, how good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, a golden snake was bright, and a thunderbolt was about to hit. The deafening, scared the orangutan one by one, hugged each other, dare not move.  Ying Qiong wanted to avoid it in the woods. Who knew that when he looked around, he was ten feet away from his body. The forest was beaten by wind and rain, and it sounded like a wave of waves, like a Mercedes -Benz, and the sound of thunder and lightning was deafening. At first the doubt was raining east, so only one place. When turning around, in addition to the few acres of your own, there are heavy rain and pouring, and mud splashes. Only dozens of places near you have no rain, it is so surprised. Try to walk for dozens of steps. Where did she go? There was no rain around ten feet away. It is not too early to calculate the time, and it is bound to stay in the cave for another night tonight. Seeing the more gloomy that day, the rain is getting bigger and bigger. Unlike the spirit that will stop, it will decide to recognize the path back to the hole. The orangutan carried his death and wounded companion, trembling one by one, beside Yingqiong, walking with Ying Qiong. These peaks were originally rough and exquisite, and the rain was increased. The rainwater in the middle brought together dozens of hanging waterfalls from high places, and the Galaxy landed down like a diarrhea. Within ten feet on the face, there are still some paths; outside the ten feet, there is a lot of smoke and a piece of it. Occasionally, when I saw one or two peaks, the hidden time appeared. The spring waterfall diarrhea was in the stream. The roar was like thunder. Yingqiong watched the rain scene all the way, getting closer to the cave, and the rain gradually became smaller. Looking at the door of the cave, sparse and falling, hung two or three silver curtains. When you saw it recently, the rain flew down from the height of the cave, just like a crystal curtain. Walking into the cave from the waterless gap, the ears were full of beasts, and those horse bears did not know when they ran back. Except for the large stone, the surroundings of the cave climbed all over the ground, leaving only a wide space of three feet.  After Yingqiong entered the cave, she sat down. Those horse bears roared all around, and they kept their front paws and worshiped. Ying Qiong suspected that they were noisy and shouted. The whole hole was silent, and there was no sound except the orangutan and bear breathing. The female beast king saw the orangutan and the bear was so unhappy. Seeing that the rain outside the cave was slightly smaller, I still couldn&rsquo;t hold it. The sky outside the cave gradually haze, but the cave was still bright. He held the sword, the stones, and looked for the different treasures she wanted to glow in her heart. After three or four hours, the sky was in the middle of the night, and it was still not looking for it. After eating He Shouwu, she didn&rsquo;t feel hungry, and she didn&rsquo;t feel tired. It seemed to find this for a while, rest for a while, and rose down on the throne of this stone until it was Mingming, and it was not found. When the Ma Xiong saw Ying Qiong&rsquo;s go, he hurriedly scattered and said nothing. The old orangutan seemed to know Ying Qiong&rsquo;s heart, and also helped Yingqiong to find it. Sometimes she picked up two transparent stones and fought with Ying Qiong. Ying Qiong was also very happy at first. He got outside the cave and tried secretly without any misconduct. Seeing that the old orangutan followed, knowing it was understanding, and asked it, &ldquo;Do you know the light in the cave because of the day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orangutan shook his head. Ying Qiong knew it was not known. Because he saw it as diligent and wise, he moved in his heart and said, &ldquo;You orangutan is good, but unfortunately you can’t take you to Emei to guard me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>La Yingqiong&rsquo;s sleeves, kneeling down and hoeing. Ying Qiong knows that it can solve people&rsquo;s words, and then said, &ldquo;Looking at you, it seems to be willing to go with me. As long as I leave, you can do it with one heart and do not harm the spirit. When I become a sword fairy, I will come immediately. You can. &quot;</p>
<p>The orangutan shook his head. Ying Qiong was still looking at it, still looking for. The orangutan suddenly realized that she pulled Yingqiong&rsquo;s sleeves and led Ying Qiong to sit down with gestures. With a long whistle, the hundreds of orangutans were launched and looked for it. Except for the big stone sitting by Ying Qiong, this cave almost did not turn over the orangutan, and it was still no trace. At first, Ying Qiong thought that these orangutans had lived in this hole for a long time. Since asking themselves to sit and watch, they must find something to find. Who knew that there was still no effect and gradually disappointed. It turned out that I planned to find the baby. The next day, Tianming moved. Who knew the baby was not looking for it, and the heavy rain was gradually stopped for another two days and three nights.  On the third day of Tianming, Ying Qiong stared at the cave. The branches are good birds, Cui Yu is still wet, and she is beautiful. The underground red petals are messy. Nearly 100 peaks and mountains, blue like new washing, and the depth of Dai color, set off the denseness of the valley. Coupled with the new waterfall after the rain in the mountains, the sound of the sound, the green grass fresh fat, the wild flowers are blooming, Chaoyu Hanhui, Chun Shao&rsquo;s eyes, the good scenery is full of poor eyes. This natural picture, slowly speaking, a reporter is difficult to describe, and the famous sage of the painting garden is underground, and it may not be able to collect this endless mountain. Seeing that the sky was clear, the valley after the rain was so wonderful that she couldn&rsquo;t help but be ecstatic, wandering in this infinite spring light. Suddenly a light wind blew, the residual flowers on the peach plum tree, such as white snow and red rain, slowly flushed the ground with the wind, could not help but move back.
At this time, the whole hole of the orangutan and bear also understood that the Lord could not stay for a long time.</p>
<p>The orangutan followed Ying Qiong, Cheng Yanxi.</p>
<p>Ying Qiongtian is heroic.</p>
<p>After living in this hole for a few days, the orangutan is used to it.</p>
<p>Although the beasts were unprepared, those oranges and bears knew that she was grateful to Dade, and regarded Yingqiong as a deity.</p>
<p>When I saw Yingqiong enter the cave to pick up the package, I knew that she would have a long line, one by one, kneeling, and long necks.</p>
<p>In some eyes, many beast tears flowed by humans.</p>
<p>The roar of the orangutan was extremely scarred, and the roar of the horse bears was even more like a thousand drums, shaking the valley.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong hated these two kinds of calls most.</p>
<p>For the three days in the cave, when they met them, they immediately prohibited.</p>
<p>They are quite spiritual and can be known, rarely call.</p>
<p>Today, Yingqiong is to be different from them, thinking that they have to listen to their welcome voices, at least after their own swordsmanship.</p>
<p>So not only did not prohibit, but they were called drums, majestic and desolate, and they were extremely nice.</p>
<p>I also love the scenery in the mountains and the climate, and I can&rsquo;t help but think of it.</p>
<p>At the moment, he will be discriminated on a small lone peak about three or four feet high.</p>
<p>The orangutan and Xiong saw Ying Qiong, and hurriedly walked around, kneeling the Shi Feng into a circle, raised his head, and shouted more and more.</p>
<p>In this thousands of beasts, Ying Qiong naturally advocated support, where she was independent and proud of her pride, and suddenly saw a white dot like a silver geese far away, flying towards the peak head, and her approaching.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong has already seen that the person who came was a white woman, and she was quite beautiful.</p>
<p>She knew that she was a first -class swordsman and was happy in her heart.</p>
<p>It was about to call loudly.</p>
<p>The woman in white was still a lot of light from Ying Qiong&rsquo;s standing.</p>
<p>The horse bears under the peak could not escape, and immediately there were three or four different heads.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong realized that the comer was the enemy, not a friend, and was shocked and angry.</p>
<p>After she ate He Shouwu, she was already as light as a swallow, and she was so hard that she had no hard time.</p>
<p>At this time, because I got along with the bear and the orangutan for several days, the emotions were deep.</p>
<p>When I saw the enemy&rsquo;s sword light, the orangutan and bear fled.</p>
<p>Those oranges and bears were also anxious.</p>
<p>The blue light was also like a meteor and chased.</p>
<p>Yingqiong was shocked.</p>
<p>A dozen years old purple light came out of the box, and the purple was dazzling, and he went straight towards the glael.</p>
<p>The blue light seemed to have consciousness, and Huo Di retreated.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong saw the sword sword and was afraid of his sword, and immediately became bold.</p>
