    <h1>The eleventh time he devoted himself to avoid disaster and lived a small foil.</h1>
    <p>The eleventh time he devoted himself to avoid disaster and lived a small foil.</p>
<p>It is said that Zhou Chun and Mao Tai played against each other.</p>
<p>They were in a crisis.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the drunk Taoist ran to help.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the sword light of Mao Tai and the drunk Taoist, there was a sound of breaking in the air in the air, and then five red lines flew.</p>
<p>The drunk Taoist quickly pinched Zhou Chun, accepted the sword light, and flew to the city.</p>
<p>Zhou Chun closed his eyes, but his ears were listening to the wind.</p>
<p>When the film, he had fallen in a quiet place outside the Wuhou word outside the city.</p>
<p>Zhou Chun knelt down quickly, thanking the drunk Taoist for saving his life.</p>
<p>The drunk Taoist did not answer.</p>
<p>He walked to a Maoist and led Zhou Chun to push the door in.</p>
<p>Zhou Chun saw it, and the Yunfang was cleaned very clean.</p>
<p>There are two twelve -year -old Taoism in the room.</p>
<p>Seeing the two came in, they went to pour tea.</p>
<p>The drunk Taoist knew that Zhou Chun had not had dinner, so he was preparing for wine.</p>
<p>After the two Taoist children retreated, Zhou Chun knelt down again, and repeatedly asked the drunk Taoist to collect it as a disciple under the door.</p>
<p>Drunk and humane: &ldquo;On your heart and the same foundation, you can&rsquo;t make it. It&rsquo;s just that you are forty years old, but you are not childhood. Learning your sword is particularly difficult. I am afraid that I am hard to be a teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Chun repeatedly asked for a long time, and the drunk Taoist said, &ldquo;I am not a disciple who does not accept you. Yiyuan Shendan, you have broken your child&rsquo;s body, and it is not hindered. You think you are not in this religious person, why should I have always been with you from Emei? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Chunzhi knows the truth, but dare not reluctant. I do n’t know who the second old one is Songshan. I ask the drunk Taoist several times. Just answering the opportunity, naturally I knew that it was not beneficial at this time, and I didn&rsquo;t dare to ask more. After a while, Dao Tong sent wine and food. Zhou Chun used it. After a day of tiredness, Dao Tong led him to the partial house.  I woke up early the next morning and went to the cloud room to see. I did not know where to go. Two Taoism children, a Songer, a crane. Zhou Chun asked Song Er: &ldquo;Where did Master go? Last night, he asked in a hurry and never asked the real name of his old man. The two little brothers followed Master for many years, and I must know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Songer replied: &ldquo;My master is not Often in the temple. On March, I did n’t see it once or twice. I did n’t leave a word when walking this morning. As for the names of his old man, we do n’t even know. Most of them call him drunk; someone comes to him, only to find the drunk Taoist. Presumably this is his name. The name of this place is Biyuan, but the big disciple of Shen Ni You&rsquo;s disciple. The place is quiet here and borrows temporarily. We come here, but for more than half a year, no one is here. If you are in Chengdu, why should you move your luggage to live? I listen to Master said, you are good in martial arts. Teach us. Are you willing? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Chun saw that he spoke clever. The place where he lived was naturally cleaner than the shop. Since the drunk Taoist took him here, he would never be unwilling, and he nodded and agreed. Then asked the path, returned to the city store, counted the shop account, moved into the middle of the house, to avoid disaster, and usually did not go out. After the drunk Taoist went, he did not come back for many days. He talked with the Er Tong daily, and he was not very lonely.  He is an experienced person. Whenever he talks about martial arts, he manages my past and dare not talk about it. One morning, I got up very early, and I heard that there was a slight vertical jump in the courtyard. Looking at the window, I saw Song and He two children. One person took a skill of bamboo sword and stabbed each other in the courtyard. At first, it was not surprising, and the movement was very slow, as if it was more than the posture, but it was very stable. Later, Zhou Chun did not pay attention to coughed. Song and Hei Tong knew that Zhou Chun peeked in the room. The talent in the Liuhe Sword couldn&rsquo;t tell his body. When I was able to see the gods, Suddenly Songer sold a flaw, which made a cracker&rsquo;s wings solve. The crane was even more unhappy. ! &ldquo;Ru Fei pierced to Song&rsquo;er&rsquo;s chest. Zhou Chun could see clearly, thinking that Song Er was in trouble this time, and was anxious for him. Speaking of time, at that time, I saw Song Er who did not accept the sword to pick it up. Squeaking, a god eagle caught rabbit, flew down, and a sword stabbed behind the crane. Here heard the wind behind his head and knew it was not good. He hurriedly moved forward, turned around, his back was lying on the ground, his face facing the sky, and a solution to the drunk eight fairy swords. I just avoided Song&rsquo;er&rsquo;s sword, and when I was busy, I saw something and flew towards her face. He&rsquo;er shouted, &quot;</p>
<p>Good come!&rdquo; On his back, a carp beaten, and he flew out seven or eight feet high. The left foot pad and the right foot, so that a swallow made three copies of the water and the water, and the two or three pads were enough for the Guizhi in front of the court and turned over the tree to breathe. Said: &quot;</p>
<p>Brother is not ashamed, can&rsquo;t fight, do you still bring the hidden weapon?&rdquo; Song Er replied with a smile: &quot;</p>
<p>Which makes the hidden weapon? Trushing me in the air, there is a group of birds flying over, and I pierced it. , Unintentional from the sword head. Who hits you with a hidden weapon? &quot;  Zhou Chun came out of the house, and it was a dead sparrow. He was stabbed in the neck by Song&rsquo;er bamboo sword. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>At a young age of the two, there are already such leaders. Fortunately, they are holding their eyes and never bragging their eyes.&rdquo; At this time, He&rsquo;er also came down from the tree, rubbed Zhou Chun again, and told him to dance a sword. Zhou Chun admired the two of him, how dare to do it easily. Later, he could not be forced, and then took out his five plum blossoms through the cloud crossbow and tried it. Because Song and Hei Er Tong did not allow them to learn hidden weapons, and after watching Zhou Chun&rsquo;s stunt, they told Zhou Chun that they would hide from Master to learn. Zhou Chun had to agree to teach every day. He also got a lot of secrets of swordsmanship with Er Tong, and did not wait to worship, first practice. It seemed that after more than ten days, Zhou Chun suddenly remembered her daughter Qingyun. She said that she would come to Chengdu soon soon. When she moved away, she didn&rsquo;t leave a word. I am afraid she couldn&rsquo;t find it. The drunk Taoist also said that he would encounter a famous teacher soon. If he always hidden in the 庵, only the picture can be avoided, when can you meet a good opportunity? Tongsong and He two children explained that they planned to go out to find teachers every day to visit friends. If they did not return for three consecutive days, the accident had occurred. The two asked him to try to report to the drunk Taoist. The second child agreed one by one.  He had lunch, and had a two -child child. One person walked out of Bi Yan and did not enter the city. He was in the Wuhou Temple of Wuhou Temple outside the Qingyang Palace outside the city. Sometimes I ran upstairs in Wangjiang to rest, and by the way, I went into some diet. It was still a few days after this, and still had nothing to meet. One day, when I walked in the store where I lived in the city, I asked someone to come to visit since he moved away. The shop answered: &quot;</p>
<p>One or two days ago, there was a tall old man about 50 years old, and the same red -faced old monk came to ask you. We saw that you were busy on the same day, just turn around your hometown, just turn around in your hometown, I have to say that you have been moving for many days and do n’t know how to go. I think the guest ’s face is very disappointed. Leave a word when you go, saying that if you are returning from the guests or Zhou, you can say that Emei old friends have now followed the white eyebrow monk to Yunwu Mountain. When you become a monk, you do n’t have to go back to his hometown. Ask him the surname, he refuses to say, do you want to be your old friend? &ldquo;Zhou Chun inquired about the appearance of the person, knowing that it was Li Ning To become a monk, why is his daughter Ying Qiong? He told himself not to go to Emei, presumably Mao Tai was found there. In my heart, I was going to go to Emei for several days to see what happened.  He just perfunctory the store and said a few words. When I walked to the street, I suddenly saw a cluster around, noisy there. He walked close to a look at the streets of a shop, sitting on the streets of a shop, sitting with a thin and dry old man, wearing it very tabbed, closed his eyes tightly, without saying a word. The people next to them also laughed and scolded, and some gossip. From the beginning of Zhou Chun, he knew that the old man ran to this rice shop from early morning to ask for alcohol and vegetables. After eating one, he just slipped out while the shop was not concerned. The store had long been suspicious that he was deceiving and drinking, and suddenly found that he was running away. How could he let it go easily. As soon as he walked to the door, he chased it out. I was about to pull him back. I didn&rsquo;t want to tear up a broken coat he wore in half. The old man was furious, not only did he not acknowledge that he was running away, but he would call the shop to lose his coat; and also said that he came out to see the excitement, for fear that the store would not be assured, so he left his baggage. The store went in to check, and it really had a worn -out baggage. Who wants to open it in front of everyone, in addition to a few scattered silver, there is a bunch of pearls, with soybeans, and 108. So the old man was particularly reasonable, and he said that the shop should not be underestimated. &quot;</p>
<p>I am so valuable in your shop. How can you suspect that I cheated the lunch? My dress is more expensive than the pearl. Now you are torn by you. Just hang it here. &ldquo;Everyone persuaded it to persuade him. Whoever intends to be near, he is desperate with anyone, and let the store lose clothes.
Zhou Chun listened, and felt very strange.</p>
<p>He went closer and went to see it.</p>
<p>I saw that the old man was very torn, with a muddy face, dragging two broken shoes, exposed to the heels, thin and dark, and there was really a black and black.</p>
<p>A small bag.</p>
<p>The store stood beside, said good words, and flushed his face.</p>
<p>The old man just closed his eyes and didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p>
<p>Zhou Chun feels more strange.</p>
<p>Looking at the pitiful spirit of the store, I couldn&rsquo;t bear it, I was planning to persuade a few words.</p>
<p>The old man suddenly opened his eyes and saw Zhou Chun and said, &ldquo;You are here, I can count you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Chun said: &ldquo;Why did your old man feel so angry with them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man said, &quot; I. If you are my good apprentice, hurry up to dismantle his room and burn his room. Did you hear it? &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Chun was inexplicable. When the person next to him heard the old man talking to Zhou Chun, he saw the instrument of the people. He thought: &ldquo;The horizontal old man is so horizontal, and it turns out that there is such a vanguistic apprentice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the shop listened, he was so anxious that he was waiting for Zhou Chun. Dividement. The old man has stood up and puts the bag next to him, saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re here well, let you give it to you now. But our grandfather, you can&rsquo;t set up a name for a while. You have to give me the lunch tent first. I am gone. &quot;</p>
<p>Then, go away.  The old man spoke, was a bit out of an external accent, and it was a sudden, and it was very fast. Zhou Chun was blinded by him at the time. After he left, the shop was afraid that Zhou Chun would really burn the house, but just said good. When Zhou Chun woke up, the old man had gone at this time. He did not deny that he was not an old man. Although burning the house was a joke, the old man&rsquo;s wine and rice was really embarrassed. Fortunately, Zhou Chun really had conservation, so he put down one or two or two silver, separated the crowd, went to the old man, and chased. After chasing two lanes, I never caught up. I just walked around the street and walked to the door of Wangjiang Tower. I felt a little hungry in my belly. I planned to go in and eat. He was already familiar with it. As soon as he went upstairs, he greeted Liu&rsquo;s stool and said, &ldquo;Zhou Guest, come here, please sit here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhou Chun made a look at the head and saw a table on the table. Drinking, two cups of chopsticks. There are half table dishes, and you can eat wolf borrowing; the half -table dish, but the original is not moving. Thinking that Liu Da quoted his seat wrong, he asked Liu Avenue: From here that others have not finished eating, and find another seat. &ldquo;Liu Avenue:&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is left for you. &ldquo;Zhou Chun asked,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who left me? &ldquo;Liu Aidao:&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is your old teacher. &ldquo;Zhou Chun thought of the right thing and couldn&rsquo;t help angry. Rush up, and then said, &quot;</p>
<p>Who is my teacher?&rdquo; Liu Aidao: &quot;</p>
<p>Your teacher is the poor old man. Don&rsquo;t worry about you always, or we dare not do so. I just heard it. There is an old man in the street. I want to blackmail a rice shop there. It happened that we had opened the meals here, so I went to see the excitement, and I met the teacher who was always there for your teacher. When I finished reading it, Your teacher has already asked a lot of wine here in us. He said that he had never eaten breakfast and had to wait for you to eat it. He ate half of the dishes, eat very fast, and eat a lot. Come to eat. He said, &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t let the beloved apprentice eat leftovers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He also said that the dishes he wants are what you always love to eat. So I believe he is your teacher for many years. After that, you have n’t been here yet. He said that he has something to do. You ca n’t wait for you to grow old. You have to take a step first and ask you to go to Ciyun Temple to find him. After burning the room, I have seen you as respectful to him again, and let him go. Isn&rsquo;t this right? &ldquo;Zhou Chun listened, so angry, funny, and couldn&rsquo;t tell him. However, he had to call Liu Jiang to get heated, just ate some, drink two glasses of wine, the more you want to be more angry. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>For decades, I have made people eat it for decades, and today I am eating and drinking, and I said it is my own teacher!&rdquo;  At this time, the stairs suddenly rang, shocked the floor, and took a little growing Han, purple -faced yellow beard, leopard head tiger eyes, wearing a Qingyi jumpsuit. Jiu Bao was waiting for the head to make a seat. At a glance, the man saw Zhou Chun, and then rushed over, and said to Zhou Chun loudly, &quot;</p>
<p>Are you the three old and third?&rdquo; Zhou Chun saw the man who came in a hurry, and again Unexpectedly, he was shocked. When the glass was placed, his body was slightly up, and he flew towards the window. Said: &quot;</p>
<p>I am Zhou. I and you are alive, but looking for me?&rdquo; The man heard this, haha ​​laughed, &quot;</p>
<p>No wonder the old man said you would fly, it really. Hurry up, I have something to say. &ldquo;Zhou Chun looked at the man carefully. Although he was rude, he looked upright, knowing that there was no malicious, so he flew down and repeated the seat. The man asked Zhou Chun&rsquo;s wine to run out. Zhou Chun was almost ate, and the suspect that the man had to drink, and said, &quot;</p>
<p>I am full of wine. If you want to use it, you can ask for a lot of wine.&rdquo; Suddenly, a person stood up, took out a piece of silver from his waist, and threw it on the table. Zhou Chun was waiting for humility. The man was slowly closer to him. While Zhou Chun was not concerned, Zhou Chun moved together, carried him on his body, and flew downstairs. Tao you Zhou Chun is a usual family, and he can&rsquo;t open the means. He was held by the man&rsquo;s two -handed door, and he couldn&rsquo;t play it. The people upstairs, when the big man came up, Zhou Chun flew towards the window, which was already surprised. Now seeing Zhou Chun&rsquo;s back, Yifa discussed the altar. He guessed that Zhou Chun was a pirate. The big man was an official who handled the case. Now he carried Zhou Chun away. Presumably, he must go to the reward. There are many ways to sit here, not far from Zhou Chun, there is a shengxiu, sneer in sneer, hurriedly stopped the account, and went downstairs. This is not mentioned.  It is said that Zhou Chun was on his back by the big man, and he was ashamed. He has been thinking about the rivers and lakes for decades, and has never planted his tendons. Today, there is no reason for no reason. He was gently captured by a person who did not know his name and ran away on the street. He was very sad. How can he be stretched out of the living acupoint and can&rsquo;t move. You have to look at where he goes. As long as you restore your freedom, you can fight with him. He was thinking about it, and the big man walked out of the city. Zhou Chun saw that it was the avenue of Ciyun Temple. The secret road was not good. At this time, he had arrived at the forest in front of the temple. Zhou Chun was annoyed, but he was pulled up for a while and was numb for a while. He was numb all over his body. After going down the ground, he moved a few steps first. I was waiting to ask him why he had a joke, and saw a bright eyes, a white light, and a eighteen nineteenth Wensheng show in front of him, wearing a white satin clothes. When I looked at the Han Dynasty, I was stunned, standing there, and the hot sweat was dumped by the teenager&rsquo;s acupoint. I was about to ask the teenager, and I heard the teenager said, &quot;</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go upstairs, the stairs are so powerful that I will go upstairs. It ’s really shameless to use people to divide the bones and carry the bone of bones and carry them here. Now what you have, just make it out; otherwise, you do n’t blame me to humiliate you.&rdquo; Dahan listened to the teenager. Then, looking at Zhou Chun&rsquo;s eyes, as if asking for help. Zhou Chun looked at the sweat on his face like a soybean. He knew that the acupuncture point that the teenager ordered was a unique kung fu. If it was long, he would be injured. Besides, this big Han was born, and the art industry is also very found. Although he joked with himself, there must be a reason for it. Seeing his pain is unbearable. Then he said to the young man: &quot;</p>
<p>Although this person is rude, I do n’t know that he is a good person and bad person. Why should this hero, do you have to see it with him?&quot; Persuaded for a while, and saw that the boy stood there and thought it was. The teenager is big, and his heart is unhappy. To be persuaded again, whoever wants to look nearby, the boy is stunned, standing there, I do n’t know when people have been clicked. Looking at his eyes again, it is not as good as that big man can move, knowing that he must not be rescued. Zhou Chun&rsquo;s internal and external merits have reached the superior person. They were previously calculated by Dahan. They were originally cold, like ordinary acupuncture rescue. He walked to the side of the Han Dynasty and shot hard under his threat. The big man woke up slowly and sang a sting towards Zhou Chun. Looking back at the teenager standing there, he could not help but start from his heart and run away, just a kick. Zhou Chun is going to stop. That big man has a good foreign merit. This kick is less than a few hundred pounds of strength. The teenager was clicked, and he must not move, and he must not avoid it.
In this unwillingness, when he saw the teenager&rsquo;s body, he drilled out an old man, and he caught the big Han&rsquo;s feet without any trouble.</p>
<p>As soon as the old man saw the old man, he shouted, &ldquo;You told me where did you go? Where did you go? I was almost humiliated by this little king. The old man said: &quot;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be shameless, do you make it so messy? Isn&rsquo;t it me looking at him too crazy and holding him, you planted the big heel early.&rdquo; Zhou Chun saw this person at this time, and then It was the weird old man who returned his liquor for him, posing as his master, and deceived him. When he saw him like this, he knew that he was not a leisurely generation. He quickly came down and fell down, and his respect: &quot;</p>
<p>Master is above, disciple Zhou Chun meets.&quot; The old man said: &quot;</p>
<p>This will not say that I don&rsquo;t say that I am cheating wine to eat, right? ? Don&rsquo;t be busy first, I will treat this person. &ldquo;Saying, just patting the young man&rsquo;s shoulders, it was slowly waking up. The teenager&rsquo;s face was shameful, looking for a little bit, and suddenly his mouth, a white light flying out. Zhou Chun was worried about the old man, and saw the old man laughed and said, &quot;</p>
<p>The beads of rice grains are also glowing.&rdquo; He put his hand up, and he had captured Bai Guang in his hand. The white light seemed to know how to humanity. In the hands of the old man, like a snake, just flexion and stretching, as if going to escape. The teenager saw the old man collecting Jian Guang, looking at the old man, sighed, and walked around and walked away. After a few steps, the old man had stopped the way in front. The old man stopped the road, and the old man stopped the road. I was anxious in my heart, and said, &quot;</p>
<p>You ordered me acupuncture and accepted my sword light again. Poison, is this Li Yuanhua&rsquo;s slave taught you? &ldquo;The teenager listened to this and was startled. He knew that the old man must have a big head. I humiliated me in front of people, but I was so angry that I was confused for a while. I wanted to put the sword light, cut off your old man&rsquo;s hair, cover the face, but did not expect to offend the old predecessors. It is said to say that it is not allowed to take it out. Since going down the mountain, it is still the first time today. This hiding the old predecessor can be verified. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man looked at Jian Guang in his hand and said,&rdquo; Your words really really look at it. No false. When you first commit a crime, you have to spare you, and you have to punish you to do something for me. Because of my two times, those people who used the old days, died, hidden, I don’t like to find these The old man is still your youthful and vigorous people who work quickly. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he threw Jian Guang to him. The teenager quickly agreed, &ldquo;The old and senior has sent it. As long as he does not recite the rules of his teacher, goes to the fire and died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man said a few words to the teenager&rsquo;s ears, and the boy agreed one by one.  At this time, Zhou Chun knew that the big man was the woman&rsquo;s husband&rsquo;s husband, Lu Dilong Wei Qing, who was saved by Mao Tai at the beginning of the day. Just because Wei Qing came back that day, his wife said the words of Zhou Chun&rsquo;s rescue. Wei Qing naturally became angry. He must find Mao Tai and Zhou Chun. He revenge and Xie En. I accidentally met the old man and joked with him at first. Later, he pointed out that Zhou Chun was drinking in Wangjiang Tower. He said, &ldquo;You go to see him as well as, he will ignore you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Wei Qing spread his hand in the wrong way and taught him to carry Zhou Chun into the forest. Wei Qing was a muddy man, so he did what the old man said. While the old man was talking to the teenager, Zhou Chun asked what happened, and Wei Qing told Zhou Chun to tell Zhou Chun. Zhou Chun knew that he was muddy and couldn&rsquo;t blame him. At this time, the old man had led the teenager back. The young man and Zhou Chun asked the name of the old man. The old man said to the teenager: &ldquo;If you return to the mountain, you say to your master, the white old man in Songshan Young Room greets, and he knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the boy heard this, he fell down from the new and met: &ldquo;Your old man Is it a fifty years ago that the people on the rivers and lakes called the gods without shadow chasing the clouds, one of the three immortals of the East China Sea, and the Bai Lao Swordsman who was one of the two olders of Songshan? The disciples did not know Taishan, and looked at the sin. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man quickly laughed with a smile. Support. Zhou Chun knew that the old man was one of the two old men who was drunk. The old man said: &ldquo;You are asking the teacher everywhere, everyone looks down on you and refuses to include it. My old man has a special temper, and people say it is not good. I refused to come again, I won&rsquo;t accept you anymore. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhou Chun said busy:&rdquo; Master, your old man&rsquo;s game, the disciples of the naked eye, how can you know it? Your poor disciple is so hard. &quot;</p>
<p>Higgaining. The old man laughed and laughed: &ldquo;Moly you, look at your poor look. But as my apprentice, you have to have a condition, you can get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is like a mountain, and all of them. &ldquo;The old man said:&rdquo;</p>
<p>I love to eat wine the most, but I have no money. I can&rsquo;t steal wine like drunk Taoists. Three meals in the morning and evening, you have to give me a account for me. You should have it? &ldquo;Zhou Chun knew that the old man loved to joke, and respectfully agreed, and got up and stood aside. I asked the young man&rsquo;s surname to know that he was a proud disciple of Li Yuanhua, who was called, and called Sun Nan. So he asked Zhao Yaner&rsquo;s trace and knew that he was working hard now. After three years, he could come out. He was very happy for Zhao&rsquo;s mother. Sun Nan likes to wear white. Although he was born less than two years, Bai Xia&rsquo;s elegance was already on the rivers and lakes.  Everyone was talking, and suddenly the forest laughed in a while: &quot;</p>
<p>Which old seniors say to steal wine?&rdquo; The crowd seemed to take a look and walked out of the forest with a Taoist back with a red wine gourd, followed by a woman behind him. Except for Wei Qing, Judu recognized the famous sword fairy drunk, and he went forward to meet. Zhou Chun saw the woman in the black, and couldn&rsquo;t help but jump in her heart, waiting to speak, and the woman had come forward to worship him. When you look closely, it really is his love girl light cloud. Ask her why she came late? Qingyun said it was because of the magic weapon in the mountains. &quot;</p>
<p>When I met the drunk master, I knew that Dad was here with Master Bai Zu, so I came together.&rdquo; Zhou Chun led her to see the ancestor again. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>Today, Master and Drunk Taoist and others are here to meet, and it is definitely not because of the reason.&quot; When he was waiting to ask, he only listened to the drunk Taoist to chase Yun Yun: &quot;</p>
<p>We have these hero swordsmen, which can be bald in the baldness. The donkey was higher. I heard that Zhitong called Qin Lang to go to Tibet to pick medicine. When he came back, he detoured the arrow furnace. That Majue is not as important as that, but the pink noodle Buddha Yu De Chan can chase the soul red cloud sand in the five poisons. Although I am not afraid of them, how can my little brother be able to afford it: so I wait to start. When the nest is broken, the rescue of the soldiers arrived, and there was no officer. What do the old predecessors think? &quot;</p>
