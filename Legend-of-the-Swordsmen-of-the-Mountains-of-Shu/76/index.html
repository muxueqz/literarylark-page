    <p>The 75th Ten Years of Ten years of salary, the two barbaric monks, the magic, the true biography, the two generations of the two generations, the three swordsmen, the old rain midway, the old rain  Yunzhong was in a hurry and angry, without any way.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I took Yue Wen&rsquo;s two elixir, and I didn&rsquo;t feel hungry.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the second day, the short fat monk came to see twice.</p>
<p>Seeing that Yunzhong&rsquo;s expression was tough, he was not tired, and secretly surprised.</p>
<p>After a while, I would like to ask the tall monk to see again.</p>
<p>The two discussed for a while, and the dwarf monk said to Yun Zhong: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t see you, you are still a hard man. We have a thing to discuss with you. If you are obsessed, you will open up your topping and get wine with the master. How do you mean? &quot;</p>
<p>Yunzhong thought about it and replied,&rdquo; I have been captured and killed. Forced. If there is something, let me first discuss it. If it is feasible, it is not agreed; if it is those who rape and adultery, you kill me and frown, not a man. &quot;</p>
<p>That short short. The murderer said to the high monk: &ldquo;This person is really a man, much stronger than those people before. Fortunately, we are not afraid that he will escape the sky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yunzhong was tied up all day long, and he was numb. Knowing that these murderers are powerful, they will be a demon, and they will be difficult to escape. Then he asked the two murderers: &ldquo;What is troublesome, you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The short monk did not answer first, dragging Yunzhong in the court to the sun, and looked at the face of Yunzhong. Essence Then he dragged him into a Zen room in the apartment. Said: &ldquo;My name is Kazyamu, the second master of the temple. The old master was born taller than me. His name is Vanajia. We are all Tibetans, just to offend the living Buddha. He brought his men and a temple in Qingluo Mountain to study. Ten years ago, a woman came, named the god hand, the god of the gods, Bhikkhu Wei Fengniang, which was very beautiful. We should not leave her in the temple and be by her. A number of us from us with a spell flying swords, forcing the two brothers and brothers to take away our Qingluo Mountain. We helplessly, we fled to the place of Zhaoyuan Temple, and lived in this temporarily. . One is because offending the living Buddha, Tibet cannot go back; the other is reluctant to be reluctant to produce and hard -working temples in Qingluo Mountain. I originally planned to invite the capable people to recapture the Qingluo Mountain. I don’t want Wei Fengniang to smell us. Come to force us to return to the eyes of her Qingluo Mountain. She has eight apprentices, which is the famous Nishikawa Eight Magic. She is dedicated to adultery and robbery. There is no place to go, so I have to promise. This place was originally a tutium between the Sichuan -Tibet, and the travelers and people who entered the Yunnan Dynasties were greedy for the way. From time to time, they often hit their house robbers, but those who enter the Dian must go to our temple to enter the incense and giving before they are safe. Occasionally, they are killed once or twice, and they do n’t know how to go. , I am annoyed us to cause the killing of the body. Who knows that the Eight Demons are here, they have a lot of people, and they are grabbed without asking people without asking people. Come back. Gradually, the pedestrians were broken on the road. They were afraid of the wind and knew that it was the road to Qingluo Mountain, so it was forced to make eyeliners to prevent them from coming to find them to find them. Only when we have suffered, there is no production in this temple on weekdays, and the all over the road of Xiangke&rsquo;s giving, and the source of the food and clothing has been done by them, so I have to do some robbery on the border of Sichuan and Tibet. We make eyeliner and get some sheep rice cream from them every month. When they encounter a large sale, we have to send them to them. We have been swallowing for many years. . We wanted to recapture the Qingluo Mountain. Hardly.  &quot;</p>
<p>Knowing that although they are amazing, Dafa, which has a disintegration of the demon, can make them. My brother&rsquo;s brothers have this method. He should not be stolen Yuan Zhen by Wei Fengniang in Qingluo Mountain in the past few years. , I do n’t have to use it. Dafa is to practice such a good foundation, the gods with a stable god, and a strong mind. On the top of a secluded mountain, it can be achieved on the top of the West to practice. . Only in these 36 days, you have to learn to sit in advance, and then sit there as laws until you achieve great achievements. No matter what movement and all kinds of demons disrupted, you can&rsquo;t move. Not only did he abandon the previous merit, but also the worries of life. The elder brother could not practice such a Dafa because he saw that he was not a child in the temple. They are not strong, and they are lost their lives. And this kind of spell, people who have never learned other swordsmanship can be practiced, otherwise his vitality has been refined. So it ’s rare. Yesterday, the two of us who saw you had two silver, and originally wanted to take your hand as before. To attract you to see my brother, you can see that you are a child. You can do it. Later, you tied you for one day and one night before you feel that you not only have a thick endowment, especially the mind and the mind, the Yuan Shen solidifies, so you discuss with you. When Qingluo Mountain is recaptured, you can learn the secrets of my magic religion in this rare opportunity. Isn&rsquo;t it the beauty of both? But when you take it, you need to put life and death. Don&rsquo;t ignore it, and get wiped out in a blink of an eye; if you can&rsquo;t grasp the mind, you will have a worries of life immediately. I have explained the true feelings to you, if you don&rsquo;t follow, then we will not blame us to poison your hands. &quot;  At Yunzhong, when he saw him, he had a lot of suspicious points. He knew that he was not so simple, but he had become the flesh of the 俎, and he couldn&rsquo;t get out of it without any people. At the level, Zhengwan can&rsquo;t go in. If he is telling the truth, this spell can make the eight devils, wouldn&rsquo;t it be done? After calculating this interest relationship for a while, it was agreed, and then came the camera. Then agreed. Nakyin Sasaki was overjoyed, and he did not ordered people to guard Yunzhong. After going out for a while, he came in with his brother Vanajia, and said happily to Yunzhong: &quot;</p>
<p>You are really a believer, a good man! I deliberately went out for a long time, and no one cared about you, but you didn&rsquo;t want to escape at all. It would help us to succeed, and there is no doubt. &quot; In a blink of an at once, Yunzhong stepped out of the wall and walked out of the wall, holding a lot of food and eating in Yunzhong. Yunzhong was fortunate that he didn&rsquo;t want to escape. After Yunzhong&rsquo;s belly, Yingzhong went to bath and dressing, and received a net room. The people of Yunzhong are smart, and they are very good at all. The second murderer was also very happy, so he refined all the methods, secretly passed on and Yunzhong, and kept it silently. I repeatedly ordered, don&rsquo;t be afraid to meet the fantasy scene. It was at night. After three moments of Zizheng, the second collar of Vanajia went to the courtyard to go to the courtyard, and he read the Van Mantra in his mouth. After a while, Yunzhong felt that the sky turned around, and it was dark in front of him. When I woke up, I sat down on the top of the mountain, and I couldn&rsquo;t see the stars on my head. I was about to stand up, and I heard one person in my ears and said, &quot;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t move. I have sent four apprentices to protect you by your side. I come to see you once every night. Now you should do it as law. Yunzhong heard that it was the case, and he would not be a demon. He also sent someone to guard in secret. He couldn&rsquo;t help but want to escape. Not mentioned.  It is said that the heart source, the mysterious confession, the three people of the Xu and Yu disappeared, and the enemy did not come to disrupt. Seeing that Dai Jiachang was fine, he resigned with the Tiebi Taoist and Ling Cao and moved to the king of the king. Practice Tunanjian every day, and sometimes walks out of the mountain. The heart source was overlooking at the head of the peak. Suddenly, when he saw a strong man walking at the foot of the mountain, he greeted him and looked at it. It turned out that everyone was busy playing against Lucun that day. Until the end of the matter, the five heroes of the Xiangjiang River leaned, and then Wei Qing&rsquo;s wife was robbed by a white ape. Xinyuan heard that Wei Qing rushed to the rescue and had no helper. If he was relieved, he wanted to go to one or two swordsman to go with himself to help him. Master Yuqing said: &ldquo;Jiu Wen Hengshan Baixiangya has a white ape, walking like a wind, but never heard of injuries. Since his predecessor Hua Ling knows this, he informed Wei Qing to rescue him. We went to the oppositeness. &quot;</p>
<p>Xin Yuan heard the words, and asked Master Yuqing to occupy a hexagram. He knew that it was a good luck, and there was no danger. He and Wei Qing are teachers and students and friends. They do n’t see my always suspense. Suddenly they met in unintentional. They were happy, so he first asked Wei Qing to pass.
Wei Qingdao: &ldquo;For listening to Ling Zhenren that day, my wife was robbed by the white ape. He also said that the white ape lived in the white elephant cliff and walked like flying. I was afraid that I could not catch up. After taking a hand, I walked up and got quickly. When I met the five heroes of the Xiangjiang River in Gukou, Ling Zhenren didn&rsquo;t want them to help each other, and just urged me to leave. I only went out of Geyou, and I felt that my body fluttered straight forward. The big river was long, and only one shook on the shore. After walking for a while, I saw a group of white shadows in front of the northeast. Getting closer, smelling my wife&rsquo;s cry. When I went to a stone cliff, I drilled into the cave. Looking forward, the cave had been blocked by the stones. I grabbed the door of the cave with the steel in the waist, so it was easy to push the stone cave away. The white ape jumped out and used a wooden stick. I do n’t know what kind of wood was made, and I was fighting with me for a while. The ingenious figure was clever, and it was several feet high. Live. I was overturned by a stick and tied me in my hands and feet with two spring vines and dragged it into the hole. My wife was also in it, and when I was captured, I rushed to hold me and wept. The white ape. Go up and drag her, my wife is desperately grasping my clothes. When I drag it, I torn my clothes a lot to expose the dragon pattern on my arms. Then I put my wife and approached me. , Tore up my left arm clothes and reveal a red arm. I am worried that it wants to go to my wife in front of me. Seeing it to tear my clothes, I think it wants to eat me. It is very strong, I can&rsquo;t break free, I am angry with my eyes. I am nothing to do, my wife is most afraid of being raped by it. ? &quot;</p>
<p>A word reminded my wife that my wife had a fierce nature and hit the stone wall, and she was going to find it. My wife has not hit the stone wall and has been stopped by it.  &ldquo;At this time, it suddenly changed the fierce spirit just now, and compared with me by hand, and the two of me didn&rsquo;t understand. It seemed to be in front of me again, and I was afraid that my wife would die, so I would drag my wife. The tea cup. The thick spring vine was crushed by it with his hands. He untied me. My weapon was not in his hand and gave it a punch. . Then I was in a good body, because I wanted to protect my wife. I had dozens of punching punching, and it screamed. I compared me with my hands. I didn’t know it. In front of my wife, the more I hit me, the more angry. The bone of the cricket is hard. Although it hurts it, it can&rsquo;t hurt it. After a while, I have a good time to see the steel grab of my hand. I was robbed by me and picked up in my hand, and I was trying to use you to pass on the top of my scattered flower plate to hide the dragons grabbing beads. First, blind the eyes, then take the life. One person, it was the tattered Huoling real person. When he reached out, he grabbed my steel first. The white ape wanted to know him that he was terrible, and immediately gave up my wife and kneeled down. Ling Zhenren first said to the ape: &quot;</p>
<p>You have a good cultivation, what kind of heart you want to move, this is not much to fight, right? &ldquo;The white ape heard the words and hugged Ling Zhenren with a pair of black mud legs. If you want to kill it, Ling Zhenren only waves with his hands, and it seems like there is something in flatness to stop me, and you can&rsquo;t step forward. Needless to do it again. Although it shouldn&rsquo;t act as a moment and carry your wife; but if it is not good, recognize the dragon pattern of your left arm thorn, and think of you on the collection of the king&rsquo;s family in Xiangtan fifteen years ago. The grace of life -saving, based on your own, it wants to take your life, isn&rsquo;t it easy to get back, can you play it for a long time? Besides, you can go to the meeting with them. Let your wife try to escape. Fortunately, the white ape is snatched, otherwise Lu and Guo went back and understood your behavior, wouldn&rsquo;t it hurt her to be poisoned? That white ape later guarded your wife because of his feelings. In the past, you put him on the righteousness of his wife, because your wife is fierce, afraid of her death, and knowing that you will not hurt it, so if you fight, he will protect your wife and not come back. I have been here for a while, I hate this The beast should not actively act, I still have it, and happy to use your hand to punish it. Later, you have to use steel to grasp the blind eyes before I come out to stop it. Now your wife has been rescued, and this beast will not have evil heart again. . Your friend Zhao Xinyuan is at the Tiefu Taoist of Gu Wangfeng, and soon he will go to Qingluo Mountain to clean up the Eight Demons. No matter who you can meet me, most of them are fate. I will give you a small gadget. You can hold it to find it first. Relatives and friends, settle your wife. Then go to Gu Wangfeng to play the Eight Devils with them, and then have your own benefits. &quot;</p>
<p>Say, give me a soft whip of a vine. I don’t know what the name is, I don’t know what the name is, He couldn&rsquo;t ask me to ask, so he had to thank him.  &ldquo;At this time, the white ape was still kneeling in front of his knees and couldn&rsquo;t help but long. Ling Zhenhua:&rdquo;</p>
<p>I blame Hua Ling Hun Hun to not accept apprentices. The beasts have to be my apprentice. You are so hard. If you get a difficult thing to get me, I will accept you. &ldquo;The white ape nodded, and a hoeing head was like a garlic. Ling Zhenren wanted to be Knowing that it is willing, I saw that he put his hand into the white ape throat, as if hearing a crispy bone broken sound. The white ape would actually talk about people. At first, I didn&rsquo;t hear his surname Ling because the white ape was because the white apes After calling him Ling Zhenren, he followed him. After the white ape would speak, Ling Zhenren gave it two sodium medicines and took it out with my husband and wife. When he walked across the slope, he saw lying underground lying underground. With a big man, he was unconscious. There was also an interrupted dead snake and a bunch of iron arrows entangled with color. If you look closely, it is the mountain people Yao Kaijiang. When asked the reason, he knew that Ling Zhenren knew him. It&rsquo;s amazing, I&rsquo;m afraid that he will be poisoned and hurts people, first clean up his Yuanshen, and then lead to Daijia Farm and set him up. He is died because the Yuanshen is dead, and he was shocked by Ling Zhenren. . Ling Zhenren quietly instructed the white ape to take a grain of elixir and the white ape from his body. After calling it to wait for us to leave, he woke up Yao Kaijiang with a elixir first, and then carried him away. After the ape was over, he ordered my husband and wife to go with him quickly, and he sent my husband and wife to Xiangtan&rsquo;s house with his spells. He was thanking him to thank him. He only said &quot;</p>
<p>goodbye&rdquo;, and he didn&rsquo;t know where he was. After thinking about it afterwards, I remembered that the white ape was the first time I was in my teacher Wang&rsquo;s house when I was young. I saw my brother&rsquo;s five fingers Kai Shan Wang Chuanxin was caught by Hengshan Hunter and hunted in the room with an iron chain. Glind its fire, and then tame. At that time, I was young and ignorant, but couldn&rsquo;t bear to listen to it day and night. While my brother was absent, he secretly let go. At that time, I had this dragon pattern on my left arm. I didn&rsquo;t think of fifteen years of time. Its hair would turn white. I saw the dragon pattern on my body remembered the former grace and did not return my hand. After setting up his wife, come to find you, and you don&rsquo;t want to meet. I remember that there were many unsatisfactory people who had not met at Daijiachang that day, maybe it attracted me to meet? &quot;</p>
<p>Heart Yuan informed the past one by one, and went to the Tiebi Taoist and Huang Xuanji with him one by one.  From then on, Wei Qing rushed to Qingluo Mountain before the Duanyang Festival and other Duanyang Festival. Heng Yu and his sister Xiang Ying were very friendly. When Xiang Ying left, he originally said that Hanyang Bailongyu was introduced by Master Yuqing. Essence Then he moved his heart a few days earlier, bypassing Hanyang Bailongyu to see if Xiangying had been recorded. Ling Cao also supported his heart, and met the sword fairy and asked about the whereabouts of Yunzhong. If he met in Qingluo Mountain, he urged him to come back. The heart source and mysterious poles are promised one by one. Go back to discuss with the people of Tiebi, and plan to take a lead in early April. First go to Hanyang to visit Xiangying, and bring to Hengyu&rsquo;s letter. Then go to the Sword Pavilion of Manzhou to enter the Sichuan, and go to Qingluo Mountain on the side of Sichuan to go to the Eight Devils. Everyone discussed it once, because Wei Qing was traveling, fortunately, there was nothing. It was early, and he simply moved in advance. You can also watch the scenery along the way.  By the first day of April, the Tie Dao people had the same source, Xuanji, and Wei Qing, and the four started from Changsha. After walking for not many days, in Hanyang, it was easy to find Bai Longyu. When he met Master Yuanyuan&rsquo;s apprentice Red Lady, Yu Yinggu, asked Xiang Ying&rsquo;s trace, only to know the day when Master Yuqing arrived. Su Yin happened to go out to visit friends at night. Master Yuqing originally wanted to stay in Xiangying to return in the middle of the middle of the Master. Xiang Ying must be worn with Master Yuqing. Master Yuqing couldn&rsquo;t, and had to bring her to Chengdu again. The four heard the words and had to leave. Xinyuan thought of listening to Master Yuqing. Tao Jun is now studying swords in Qingcheng Mountain in Sichuan. Although this old man who has been a predecessor for many years, he is enthusiastic and embrace. It is more powerful than you can help him to Qingluo Mountain? After the four were negotiated, Huang Xuan was invited to bring Wei Qing first. Heart Yuan and the Tielun Taoist first went to Yichang Sanyou Cave to ask Master Xia Seng Yi Fan to ask for sin, and the camera invited him to help him go down the mountain. Then drove the sword light to catch up with Huang and Wei, walk along the waterway, and go to Qingcheng Mountain. The scheduled bypassing Shaanxi border was dispelled through the idea of ​​Jiange&rsquo;s boardwalk.
After the four of them broke up, the heart source and Tiekao people sword light quickly.</p>
<p>After a day, I arrived at Sanyou Cave.</p>
<p>After a while, the Tiekao Tao people came out and said that not only the monk Yifan was not in the cave, but even Xu Yan was not here.</p>
<p>There was only a deaf and dumb monk in the cave, and he couldn&rsquo;t answer what he asked him.</p>
<p>When the heart source heard the words, he followed the Tiebi Taoist.</p>
<p>The deaf monk saw the two looking for, and wanted to know how to use it.</p>
<p>At first glance, it was left by Xu Yan.</p>
<p>It turned out that Xu Yancheng dwarf Zhu Mei was guided by Zhu Mei, left Dai&rsquo;s family, and arranged some housework when he went home, and went to vote.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Sanyou Cave is upstream in Yichang.</p>
<p>It is a well -known resort.</p>
<p>People often go to visit, which is very easy to find.</p>
<p>It is also happened to be Xu Yan&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<p>When he was in the three tour, he was rushing.</p>
<p>It turned out that the Xia Seng Yifan could not be isolated from the world because of the good scenery of the three tour.</p>
<p>He first participated in the back hole, and was isolated from the front hole.</p>
<p>Somehow, exposing the traces in the eyes of a heart, spreading out, saying that there were no caves that people had not been to when there were no people who had not been to.</p>
<p>How to wait and wait.</p>
<p>Most people have many happy events.</p>
<p>From time to time, some ordinary people come to ask him for Buddhism.</p>
<p>Xia Seng Yifan was impatient and was about to leave.</p>
<p>Xu Yan happened to arrive.</p>
<p>Seeing that Xu Yifan was still thick, he was introduced by his old friend Zhu Mei, and he promised.</p>
<p>Soon after Xu Yan worshiped, Xia Monk Yifan brought Xu Yan to Deng Yishan on the side of Sichuan to visit friends.</p>
<p>Because there are many scriptures in the back cave stone wall, it is inconvenient to take away, only to find the deaf monk to guard him.</p>
<p>Xu Yan listened to Xinyuan in Daijiayuan and said that he had the same hatred and offending the Eight Devils and offending Master.</p>
<p>He was afraid that Master was special, and soon before he started, he did not dare to talk about his brother.</p>
<p>He was afraid that he did not know the trace of his master and apprentice.</p>
<p>He wrote this note before leaving, and he was transferred to deaf monks.</p>
<p>The deaf monk had committed his monk&rsquo;s abstinence because he committed his Master Snow Mountain and punished him for thirty years of deafness.</p>
<p>Xu Yan wrote about his care on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Although he was deaf and dumb, his ability still existed with his spirituality, but he had a good spirit and was full of evil spirits.</p>
<p>He was supported by Xu Yan, and when he saw the source of his heart, he delivered Xu Yan&rsquo;s note.</p>
<p>His origin, he explained when he was three times.</p>
<p>The people of the Tiebi Road saw the note.</p>
<p>He felt that this deaf monk was not an ordinary person.</p>
<p>He also saw that the monk Yifan asked him to guard the scriptures.</p>
<p>He knew that those scriptures were the true scriptures of the Western soil, and the Buddhist monk Yifan could.</p>
<p>If you care for the control, you know that there is a great history.</p>
<p>But looking at his expression, he doesn&rsquo;t seem to pretend to be deaf and can&rsquo;t figure out any intention.</p>
<p>Several times to him, the deaf monk seemed to be forced to be helpless.</p>
<p>He took a bald pen and wrote the eight words &ldquo;Siny Site, see each other again&rdquo;</p>
<p>on the paper. It&rsquo;s right. The Tiebi Taoist knew that he was unwilling to stay here. He tried to try him, pretending to ste up the Tibetan Scriptures, and walked towards the stone wall behind him. Before reaching out, the deaf monk had noticed, and saw that he raised his hand to take a pat on his head, and immediately he was full of golden light. The Tiekao Taoist knew that it was not good and couldn&rsquo;t say hello. He pulled the heart source, and his sword was united. Looking back at the golden clouds in the back, a three -foot -tall young monk chased. The Tielun Taoist was not really stealing the scriptures. It was originally tentative of his ability. He welcomed the enemy and hurt him. He had to urge Jian Guang to escape. There are about ten miles out, and the sword light will be dropped. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of him so powerful! I dumb because of suspicion that he pretended to be deaf, and tried him on purpose. I didn&rsquo;t want him to misunderstand it. I could still resist it. His origin, like Snow Mountain, the faction of the Buddhist Sword of the Buddhist Monkey. Now that the teacher has arrived in Deng Yan, there is a closer to Qingluo Mountain, maybe you will go for you. &quot;</p>
<p>May be so good. The disciples have no other thoughts now. I hope to get rid of the Eight Demons. No answer. At present, the sword light is driving, and the two of them are caught up with Huang and Wei, and they are marching together to Sichuan.  Wei Qing&rsquo;s footbuilding is fast. After a few days, the four arrived in Chengdu. First look at the four famous ancestral temples outside the city, and go to the village of wicked evil to meet Master Yuqing. When he saw his brothers and sisters, Master Fang Zhiqing had taken Xiangying to find the master. Qingyun and Wen Qi did not see Master Mei Xia for a long time. They missed it in their hearts and went back to Huangshan. The four talked for a while and resigned. Heart source was anxious to see Tao Jun and urged to go to Qingcheng Mountain, Guanxian. When I arrived at the Golden Whip Cliff in Qingcheng, I saw that Tao Jun and Master Jiden were sitting chess. It turned out that since I arrived in Qingcheng, Tao Jun was taught by the dwarf Zhu Mei, and practiced swordsmanship daily, and Gekeden has given guidance from the side. It has made a very fast progress. One is well -handed and commanded. Jideng is more special than his master, and he will be very uncomfortable with Tao Jun. The two of him finished their homework every day. On this day, the weather was fine, and the two played chess again, and suddenly they saw four people under the cliff. Jideng recognized the Tiebi Taoist and quickly stepped forward to meet. Tao Jun has seen one of his former Master Zhao Xinyuan. Xinyuan hurriedly pulled and said, &ldquo;The virtuous brother is about to rest like this. In the past, I knew that I had no ability to have enough ability. It is necessary to call it before, not only wrong, but also self -proclaiming. It is better to use his brother to be called by his brothers. &quot;</p>
<p>Tao Jun still refused, and his heart source had to be temporarily by him. I introduced each other and introduced their names. If they told each other for a while, Jideng asked everyone to go to the viewing.  After sitting, talk about each other. Tao Jun heard that Xu Yan had been included in Mongolian Monkey Monk, and he was very happy for him. When Xinyuan farewell to him, he went to Changsha Valley Wangfeng to visit the Tieki Taoist without encountering it. The snowy night met the second demon, chased the clouds and siege. Hua Qi Shen Ling Hun was born in the second birth of Yao Kaijiang. Bai, Yu, Ling, and Dai four people abandoned their families and other things, and said it again. Tao Jun also met Zhu Mei, a teacher, who met in the Hanjie River, and said to the Qingcheng Mountain to learn the road, and now the situation of work in the morning and evening. Ji Dengdao; &ldquo;This old Ling, a monster, is really a monster in Jianxian. If you want to talk about the lead, although I do n’t know how big, I have heard his forewords in the past years. No one said that he was defeated in his hands. Listening to Master said that he has recently enlightened the heavenly man and soon returned to his true people. He wanted to find one or two heirs, and he must have been out of the mountain for the second time. Wei Daoyou went to Qingluo Mountain with three, and he would definitely come out at that time. Even though the Eight Demons were powerful, would it be his opponent of his old man? Zhao Daoyou went forward, and he must be lost. &quot;</p>
<p>The heart source asked Ji and Tao to introduce Zhu Mei. Tao Jundao: &ldquo;The teacher of the teacher and his old man&rsquo;s whereabouts are uncertain and not often watched. Maybe we are missing, and his old man may immediately appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The four of them could hear Zhu Mei who was not in the view. Ji Deng suddenly laughed at Tao Jun: &ldquo;Do you want to ask Master to help Zhao Daoyou&rsquo;s power?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tao Hook said, &ldquo;Is there any reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master doesn&rsquo;t like me. I think he is looking for you. You will be equivalent to Zhao Daoyou as now. You are not an opponent of the Eight Devils. There is nowhere to use, the heart source is his good teacher friend, and he is willing to help you. Just because of the name of the Eight Devils, I estimate that my ability is limited, and I have not been ordered to have a master, and I dare not say it rashly. Listening to Jiden said, knowing that he was willing to treat Master, he was alive, and replied, &ldquo;I really want to follow, one has no master&rsquo;s life. The road is far away, I am afraid that Teacher Zhao&rsquo;s major affairs, so it is difficult. &quot;</p>
<p>Ji Deng said:&rdquo; I call you, of course, I will take it for you. Not only can you keep up with the three of them. Can be sent to him. Fortunately, it is still early, and I intend to leaving you for a few days. Although I can&rsquo;t help each other at that time, I will send my younger brother to sightseeing. What do you think? &quot;</p>
<p>Reunion, watching him learned swordsmanship from Zhu Mei, he was happy to be a good generation. Because he didn&rsquo;t listen to the teacher at the beginning, he only learned a little fur and rashly went down the mountain, causing Master to see the strangeness, and he suffered a loss everywhere. He didn&rsquo;t think about Tao Jun. The agent said that he was a disciple of Zhu Mei, and his swordsmanship was high. It was already early. He was happy to meet the old rain for a long time, and he pulled two helpers. Huang and Wei were originally invited by the heart source, and there was no problem. Tiebi Dao people, the two old, the monk Yifan, the heart source, the heart source, the teacher and the students, and the teachers and students of Ji Deng, they all made friends before. His swordsmanship was first passed from the end of the south, and after he became a way, he left the end of the south. Ji Deng and Xinyuan all died of the ceremony of his juniors because he knew Master. He did not live in this way. This time, as the heart source entered the Dian through the Sichuan, I wanted to visit the two friends on the way halfway, and when I saw the heart source, I temporarily lived in Qingcheng, and they told everyone that they rushed to Qingluo Mountain before the prospective Duanyang. Go, stay with everyone for the time being. Ji Deng couldn&rsquo;t keep it, so he had to send him to him. After the people of the Tiebi Dao did not go to the heart source, the three people, including the heart source, stayed in Qingcheng, waiting for Duanyang to arrive. Not mentioned.</p>
