    <p>105 times to lose the abyss of the abyss, twilight nights, the twilight nights are shocked, the filial piety of the filial piety, the wind and the dust recklessness, the sound  Yun looked at the cliff from the cliff.</p>
<p>I thought: &ldquo;Last night, I touched the ground with the sword and walked all the way, all of which were on the spot. I used to remember that there was a gap, and the sword light saw that it was a groove of more than a foot. Recently. If you are not tired at that time, you ca n’t walk anymore, take a little more steps, and fall into the deep pond, afraid of not shattered your bones? &quot;</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he was anxious to sweat, and felt a little dizzy. Look again. When you go to find a small child, I do n’t know how the way should be. He shouted a few times and agreed. Simplicate last night, I thought that getting further and further away, I turned back to find the way. And like this is very flat, but the road is very twists and turns, and there are not many trees. When I walked around, I suddenly saw the dangerous cliffs on both sides of the front, and the exit road was divided into around. I thought for a while and thought about it. The left half of the cliff stretched out the side of the road, but the right half was shrunk.  From just now to the right of the cliff, Yun saw the mountains and the cliffs, all of which were strange flowers and old pines, red purple Fangfei, and green. For the cliffs, thousands of plum blossoms are mixed between Guangyuan Fengcao. Huacheng is like snow, the barrier is fragrant, and there are times, and there are singing birds and emerald feathers flying. The waterfall on the cliff is flowing into a stream, and the white rock is like a hero. The stream of the stream is intertwined with Quan Xiang Songtao. If you do n’t care about Xiao San&rsquo;er worried about the danger, you will almost be unbearable. After finishing the cliff along the stream, turn to a mountain ring, and walk under a cliff. In this valley, the duke is undulating, the grass is full, and the mountains are very sinister. There are pine plums, mixed cliff gaps. Compared with the scenery, Tsinghua is beautiful, and it is more than Tianyuan. Yun shouted all the way all the way, looking back at Merlin Jingzhi from time to time. Between the righteousness, the nose was stunned. Looking up, on the top of the Panshi at the height of the three or four feet from the head, a white tiger was climbing with a white tiger. Send power. Yun Zeng had seen this, so he was scared to see the second glance, and ran away. Escape from half arrows, suddenly listening to the tiger&rsquo;s crazy howling behind him, ascending the mountains and valleys, the wind and the wind, the four outside grass was like waves, rolling up. Take a closer look, for fear that there are no hundreds of big tigers, running out of the grass. Yun escaped from a hurry, and the parcel was parked, and he would forget to remove it, and he ran very cumbersome. When I think of unloading, those big tigers have been surrounded by all directions. Yun&rsquo;s heart was cracked, seeing that there was no way to escape, and he suddenly moved, thinking: &ldquo;Death and life, although he is not first -class than the swordsman. According to his wife Yu Zhen, because Master&rsquo;s swordsmanship is the true biography of Emei, for a few months, it is usually time. Usually Dozens of people want to be approaching. Especially this bite of frosty swords, blowing hair and iron. I learned their skills, why not fight him? &quot;</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I didn&rsquo;t wait for that tiger, first dance the sword. The sword reflected the sunlight, and it was different in blue and shiny. Those tiger groups were near, waiting for the moment, when I saw such a scene, I wanted to know it. The big tiger shouted twice, and first spinned his body to retreat. The rest of the tigers also poured into the grass, and there was no trace in a blink of an eye.  Yun Congzhi is the power of Master&rsquo;s Sword, and the courage is strong. At this time, I felt hungry in my belly, because there were not many food leftovers. I wonder if I could go out of the mountain today, and I was afraid that I couldn&rsquo;t eat Xiao San&rsquo;er. If you want to die, you only need to find the waterfall in the waterfall last night, and you can follow it. Who knew that when he went straight to the noon card, Yun Cong was anxious, showing his work hard, and running and shouting. Nothing can be seen. He was running around the road, getting farther and farther, until the afternoon, exhausted his whole body, and burned in hunger and fire. However, I took out the food left yesterday. There were seven pot helmets left, and the bacon was available. I ate a small and a half, and resolved my stomach and hungry. After drinking some mountain springs, I resting for a while, and the solar industry has already been in the mountains. Knowing that I ca n’t find it, I ’m afraid it’ s hard to go out of the mountain tonight. I have to prepare for preparation, so I have to struggle. This time, they are desperate, and let&rsquo;s talk about it.  Not far away, see a stone hole next to the cliff. When you enter the inside, the cave is very clean, and the bedding is opened and paved. It was almost at dusk when entering the hole, watching and seeing nearby, and in case of thinking. After watching it for a while, there was still no sign. When I went down the mountain, I suddenly saw a black shadow in the woods next to the road. Yun from the bird of shocking, quickly raised his sword to prepare. When you look at it, a golden hair and ape -like ape -like ape, such as flying out of the forest, if you flutter the wind, go to the opposite peak in a blink of an eye. Yun from because it did not come to violate, he was only a little frightened and was ready to return to the cave. Stepping on the same soft things under the feet, looking down, it was a coat worn by Xiao San&rsquo;er. I do n’t know what was torn by something. Seeing many big tigers again, it was known that he was sure. Think of the followers since childhood. Regret not to take a sedan horse and walk away, hurting him in the tiger&rsquo;s mouth, and couldn&rsquo;t help crying. After all, the scholars were sore. He saw Xiao San&rsquo;s death, leaving only one bloody clothes. Without bones, he wanted to use a sword to dig soil and buried it as a grave. The sword was as sharp as the sharp, and the stone was like a powder. Yun Cong used a sword to draw the six characters of &ldquo;Righteous Servant Sanyi&rdquo;</p>
<p>on the rocks. Everything is done, it is already the setting sun, and the color is twilight. I dare not like the night of the night yesterday. I just remembered that there were a lot of beasts here. This hole knew that it was not their nest, fell asleep when they were young, and came to infringe up. After a while, I moved a lot of stones outside the cave. When two stone piles were piled up in the cave door, it was not firmly done, so I did not touch it. Consciousness. Pack the stone, the strength of the committee is exhausted, and it can no longer move. Because he worked hard for a while, as soon as he fell to the ground, he slept like death.  A dream is very comfortable. Suddenly, something is dazzling. When you wake up, the sun is shot on the face in the morning. I thought to it: &ldquo;I slept so much last night, and I didn&rsquo;t have any accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt hungry in my belly, and I didn&rsquo;t care about it. I rubbed my eyes slightly, stretched my waist, and walked out of the hole with a sword with a sword. This surprise is not the same as small, and when he raised his sword, he saw that the tigers were not moving. At first glance, the ground was full of blood, and the hearts of the hearts and livers were spilled all over the ground. Those tigers split their brains, and the wounds were on the back of the brain. Although they died, they all climbed to the ground. They were not lying down. How fierce that tiger and died, the killing of the tiger must be ten times more powerful than the tiger. Last night, I went through the danger of Tiger Monsters, and I didn&rsquo;t realize it. Knowing that this is not a good place, I do n’t even pay attention to things. I took the wrap back to the cave. I calculated that Xiao San was never physiological. I chose that the things that I had to use lightly. When I came out of the hole for the second time, I suddenly saw that there was a basket of the holes. There were some pine hazel apricot and many unknown mountain fruit in the basket. The calculation is a hawker who sells fruits. The mountain bank is currently hurt by the tiger and left here. When I entered the cave last night, I was late and never found it. I am worried about the food, and I am anxious in my heart. With the left and right things, he used the hand to bypass the dead tiger, endure his heart, and specialize in the idea of ​​the mountain. First think that there are both hawkers traveling and going, not far away from the mountain. Who knew that he had climbed the vine all the way, and he worked out how much hard work. He still saw the ups and downs of Gangling, and he still saw the ups and downs of the Gangling. Thinking of the things at home, anxious is also impossible. No matter what, I had to look for cave accommodation again. He was thrilling and experienced, and he dared not care about it anymore.  After finding the cave, I was optimistic about the terrain. First, I transported two big stones to the cave and lay the ground. Go out of the hole to carry the stones, stack the cave entrance, and leave only one foot wide and three feet long pores as the entrance. Then the remaining bacon, pot helmet and the pine -hazard mountain fruit were completely full. When the sky is nearly dark, you will enter the cave and stack the two large stones together. Because time is still early, to this day, only everything has to listen to the sky, no longer anxious. After falling asleep for a while, I got up and did my homework before lying. There is nothing different from the next day, and I still think that a quasi -direction goes forward. No matter where it is, there is a way to go out of the mountain. In this way, it has worked hard for more than ten days in the mountains. On the last day, I saw that there were villages in the distance, and there were several mountains. Knowing that since practicing swordsmanship, the experience of widening in Nikki has increased its eyesight, and it has to go at least one or two days before you can go there. Finally, I have hope, and my heart is a little comfortable. For a long time left home, I decided that as soon as there was a place for a cigarette place, I asked the path, and then hired a car and a car, and went to Chengdu to invite Master to the same time as soon as possible, so as not to suspense with parents and wives. At first glance, I was put on the basket of Zhongshan fruit, and I also put it for three days. I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of picking up the basket on the day of the next day, and the food was broken the next day. many? If the life should not be absolute, the gods are silent, why is it disappeared? This night, I saw a suitable place to the road, and I took a break early.
There is nothing wrong with the leisure, count the mountain fruit one by one, and eat another meal, and see if there are so many tomorrow.</p>
<p>Get up early on the second day, the basket of the basket is two -tenth of them.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I ate another meal, and I went to a few half.</p>
<p>Not like the past, eating every day, so many every day.</p>
<p>I regret it, I shouldn&rsquo;t count it, break the mystery, and have two days of food for two days, and they must be cut off.</p>
<p>Although I saw a lot of wild fruit trees along the way.</p>
<p>At that time, due to inconvenient carriers, the fruit in the basket was more, and they were anxious and never paid attention to picking.</p>
<p>In the last two days, there were no trees in the tunnel, and there was no fruit tree.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I dare not neglect and work hard.</p>
<p>And Xixing until the second day of the day, and I hope to see a paddy field near the foot of the mountains in the distance.</p>
<p>With the village, there is great joy in my heart.</p>
<p>Believe it out of the mountain today in the evening.</p>
<p>There are many difficult and difficult roads along the way.</p>
<p>It was not until the west of the Japanese color that it came to the end.</p>
<p>It was a big cliff, and there was a hundred feet high below.</p>
<p>There are many roads, and some are still across the deep ponds.</p>
<p>Seeing the village below, I couldn&rsquo;t go down, and I was anxious for a while.</p>
<p>In the end, I saw a lower departure, with many vines, and the clusters were stabbing.</p>
<p>Yun was helpless, picked the rough pull, and cut off with a sword in order to grasp it, try hard, and tough.</p>
<p>Pick up the dozen big vines for two or three plates, hung the big stone first, put down the cliff, inserted the sword on the back and tied it on the back, then touched the vine with both hands, and changed his hands down.</p>
<p>People near the cliff at the bottom of the cliff, foresight that there are people on the high cliffs of the ancients, and they are very surprised.</p>
<p>The villagers were shocked, and they were watching.</p>
<p>From a moment of anxiety, there was a plate of thorns that had not been cut, and he went down to the semi -cliff.</p>
<p>He had been injured by a vine thorns many places.</p>
<p>He felt very numb.</p>
<p>Seeing that there are still two feet tall from the ground, with both hands and soreness and soreness, they can no longer support it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I have practiced light work, and I have experienced a lot of courage to experience.</p>
<p>At the moment of life and death, the pain is confused.</p>
<p>Those villagers saw that the clouds fell from the tall of the two feet, and they were shocked on behalf of him, thinking that even if they did not die, they would take serious injuries.</p>
<p>Seeing that the ground was unhappy, I couldn&rsquo;t help but thunder and drank a big color, and stepped forward to ask each other.</p>
<p>At this time, Yun swelled from both hands to one or two inches high, and he couldn&rsquo;t even speak.</p>
<p>There is an elderly man named Yao in the village.</p>
<p>He was the richest man in the village.</p>
<p>He also studied in his early years.</p>
<p>Because of his stubbornness, he led his collar and lived here.</p>
<p>It has been here for more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Although seeing Yun&rsquo;s wearing is not very luxurious, he described the mansion in the crown, and he went forward and said to Yun Cong: &ldquo;This North Douyan is a natural barrier here. At that time, seeing Yun bite from his teeth, his complexion was ugly, and at a glance, he saw Yun Cong&rsquo;s hand and said, &quot;</p>
<p>This respected brother has a thorns, no wonder you can&rsquo;t speak. Come and help him go to my house to treat healing. &ldquo;Saying, there are two strong men, one person, one side, holding the cloud from standing. From a few times, Yun wanted to speak, and he felt that it was difficult to open, his whole body was cold, and his hands pain to the extreme. He couldn&rsquo;t even thank him even if he even smiled bitterly. He nodded. Essence When I arrived at the old man&rsquo;s house, it was like a golden paper and lost consciousness. Fortunately, the owner was good, and there were medicines of detoxifying vine stabbing in the village. First, he picked out the thorns with a needle one by one, applied the antidote, and drank rice soup day and night. For two days, the poison is solved, but the thrilling labor that has suffered in the mountains for more than ten days, the wind, cold and humidity, one attack together, and the illness and illness. After two days of medical treatment, I asked the name name, called Wansong Mountain, with hundreds of miles of insulation ridges, and the end has entered the hinterland of Yunnan. The mountains around the mountains are only a trail of 800 miles of mountain trails, which can be connected to Kunming Province. If you want to enter Sichuan, you must go to Dabanqiao near Kunming, and then hire a boat on the road.  Yun Zhi was in trouble, and remembered his parents and wife, so he told his owner. I only concealed the existing hidden dangers at home, saying that I have a big deal. I have been going out for many days. I was eager to find someone to find someone, and decided to bring the illness on the road. Ask the owner to try to find a generation step. Because of his serious situation, the old Yao was hesitant and hesitated. Yun also barely used hard work from the illness. He had sweat twice in a row and felt better. Old Yao persuaded him not to live. He had to do it at the end. He sent two old and reliable households and carried him away with a mountain pocket. Old Yao was a wealthy family. The help of life -saving could not thank him. He had to thank and thank him with his words. He asked the address of the old Yao, and he was in his heart with his two sons. Old Yao brought his son to give him a long time before he did not go back. Those two households are extremely honest, and they are used to the mountains for a long time, and they walk very quickly. Yun was unconscious and used to take care of him. From time to time, some silver money with him is even more grateful. Although it is a way to doctorate, it is more comfortable than Shanxing. There is no speech all the way.  There are twenty miles away from Dabanqiao that day, and only 28 miles away from the provincial capital. The place name is 28 ditch. Yun&rsquo;s tip from a group of three people to the store, feeling that the illness was four -tenth, and he was very happy. I just set up the wine and meals, but I heard that people were full of people and made a lot of trouble. Yun went to the door of the store to see. The next door was also a shop shop. There was a yellow cricket tree in front of the door. There was a black man tied to the tree. The two shops scolded in their mouths, holding the rattan whip and wood stick, and hit the ugly man with a raindrop. The ugly man lowered his head and let him fight, and he didn&rsquo;t make sense, and he didn&rsquo;t say a word. Yun looked strangely and shouted to ask the households to ask. The shop was inserted from the side and said, &quot;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be too much. This is a famous Lai Tieniu in the town. He did not know where the previous year. I don&rsquo;t know where to come. If you have energy and do n’t sell, you only live in the mountains to fight beasts. If you ca n’t beat it, you will be annoyed and grabbing things. Now the government is too evil, and it ’s not worth it. Once it was stirred up, he would hit him in pain. He was born with cowhide, and he was not afraid of fighting. Every time he grabbed Dongxi ate, he knew he was short and did not return him. Poisoning. Beat enough, and no one chased him when he left his hand. He had rushed in the small shop several times. Our old shopkeeper did not call him; others hit him, and persuaded him. Later, he did not come to grab It ’s a little stubborn next door, and he would hit him at first sight. He also snatched him. He always jumped into the shop when grabbing, or grabbed a pork leg. Hitting him, although he doesn&rsquo;t fight back, if you want to recapture what he snatched, twenty or thirty people can&rsquo;t be near. The next door hates him into bones, but except for a stinky meal, what is there? I will go. The guest officer foreigner, do not commit a provotering person, go from him. &quot;  Speaking of which, I suddenly saw a big fat man who came out next door, holding a burning flushed fire pliers in his hand, and even scolded: &quot;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t know Lai Tieniu! Usually, ten days and a half months, stir me. Today, I will also hit Lao Tzu&rsquo;s trap, and teach you to taste great. &ldquo;The ugly man saw that the fire tongs came, and he was anxious and wanted to break away from the rope. The leaves are flying, and they are crying. Yun had long wanted to come forward to persuade. When he was not good, he was anxious, and a drought to pull the green onion, even if he passed, and shouted, &quot;</p>
<p>And slow!&rdquo; The fat man had held it. The fat man suddenly saw the next sword -saving boy in the air, which was startled and fierce. He couldn&rsquo;t help but lose most of them. He is not afraid of fighting. This is easy to use hemp and beef tendons to twist the rope, soake it with water, and tied him up before he did not run away. In the day of Qingtian, there is no reason to see death and death, and let him go. You let him go. How much does he eat? How do I pay back? &quot;</p>
<p>The fat man heard the words, looked up and down from his eyes, and laughed: &ldquo;We are not three years old and two years old. Talking about counting. If you wait for him, you will not recognize the account.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, he ordered the two shops to stop and unbutton. The tie rope was originally strong, soaked through the water, swelling, and was earned by the dwarf, the buttons were all tight, and I wanted to solve it. The ugly man still earned him, and he scolded in his mouth, and shouted, &ldquo;Good people want to take a lot of time, I don&rsquo;t be afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fat man saw him scolding, grabbing the whip, and going up again.
Yun Congfang wanted to persuade him, and said that he was late.</p>
<p>At that time, he heard the card and the cards loudly, the dust was flying, and the audience fled.</p>
<p>A yellow barrel tree with a thick thickness was broken by the ugly Han Dynasty.</p>
<p>Bringing a tree towards the fat man.</p>
<p>One is fierce, the hands are tied up, the root of the tree is broken, and there are ruler, with many roots, and can walk.</p>
<p>Before taking two steps, he had already taken the tree and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The fat man didn&rsquo;t know well for a long time.</p>
<p>He ran into the shop with two steps, grabbed a kitchen knife, and ran out.</p>
<p>From the first sight, Yun remembered that he was wearing swords.</p>
<p>Before he was close to the fat man, he pulled out his sword and out of the box.</p>
<p>The ugly man shook his body, and his back broke the tree with the leaves, and fell aside.</p>
<p>At the same time, the fat man also rushed to the knife, and shouted, &ldquo;My life is fighting with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said, he chopped the knife. From the poor momentum, Yun went up and gently stunned the sword, and the kitchen knife handle was cut off. Seeing Yun Cong&rsquo;s sword crystal is dazzling, the cold is compelling, shouting, &ldquo;The robbers are killed, the place is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, he turned around and ran. The ugly man also wanted to chase, but Yun was stopped from crossing. The ugly Han jumped in a hurry: &ldquo;Good people let go, I am strong, and I have a break. Because he scolded my dying mother last month, I remembered that I was blame that I shouldn&rsquo;t take his things. Yes, I didn&rsquo;t find him. Today, I went to the village to ask for some salt and come back to cook the vegetables. I have walked across his door. It was him who caught up with me and said that he would cook the fat bacon in the shop. Ask me? As long as you do n’t scold my mother, he agreed. I ate it for the meat, so I said that I want to hit me, and I see how much the ability I have. I did n’t talk about it beforehand. Su&rsquo;s, he had to rely on him. However, he made the clever way to tie me with a prison rope that has been soaked in his water, so that I had enough, and I couldn&rsquo;t get rid of it. I want to go around. Although he was born with divine power, he couldn&rsquo;t bear the flexible body, and he was unwilling to drop the cloud from the body, but he was anxious.  Yun Cong thought: &quot;</p>
<p>Xiao San&rsquo;er is dead, this person is so sincere and powerful. I will soon be a person in the world. What identity is? Why not make a moment with him, and to do a temporary arms.&rdquo; He said: &quot;</p>
<p>You are stubborn, don&rsquo;t listen to my persuasion, killing people is to be killed. You died, who cares about your death? Yin Ling is not safe. If you lose your hands, I would like to make friends with you and let you be a life. Eat, drink and wear. What do you think of? &ldquo;The ugly Han heard, bowed his head and thought about it, and said,&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are right. When I am there, I said that I had heavy hands. She is going to die. Now she is dead, and people are still asleep in the soil cave. There are so many wild rabbits wild boars on the mountain, no one cares about no one. I still believe in my mother, forget it. I have met a good person like you. You can say that in the front, you care about me, I can eat a lot. When you want me, you do n’t allow you to scold me. Burning me. &quot;  Yun from seeing him was naive, he didn&rsquo;t forget his mother, so he liked it. Because the fat man had shouted the place and a group of people holding a stick, he thought that there were two relatives and friends in Kunming. Busy to the Ugly Han said: &quot;</p>
<p>If you say what you say, my parts depend on, and you don&rsquo;t even hit you. You are not allowed to move now, and I will distribute it by me.&rdquo; The two of these two Launnong saw the cloud from the sword, thinking that they were going to live, and they were scared to hide. At this time, listening to Mingyun&rsquo;s meaning, they walked with confidence. Before talking, at a glance, I saw that the two places were actually acquaintances. They were happy in their hearts. They welcomed them from the command and greeted them early. When he heard that he was talking about it, Yun Cong was the master of the lift, and the guest of the old man Yao had a bid under his heart. He sent the fat man a meal early. The fat man did not accept: &quot;</p>
<p>Although I hit him cleverly, he was too bad to hurt me. Take today&rsquo;s Huangye tree, or my grandfather is planted in the time, and it is worth five or six money. Broken, do you just say, even if you say it? &ldquo;Yun Cong laughed:&rdquo;</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t have to worry first, the tree has been folded, and you can&rsquo;t resurrect. Even if he eats your bacon together, count one or two silver Right? &ldquo;The fat man was still waiting, and said the local spoke:&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are too uncomfortable. This master doesn&rsquo;t care about you, just say good, give you silver, where can I find such a persuasion in the world? Lai Tieniu Who doesn&rsquo;t know that he is not worth three dollars, can you bite him two? If you do n’t follow, the official asked you to use the offenders to fight with the criminal, and teach you not to fight. &quot; Pick up the silver and go. The place pulled again: &quot;</p>
<p>You can remember, the silver is the old master&rsquo;s purchase price. The yellow barrel tree must not be yours. If you talk about it in person, save people away, and rely on it.&rdquo; Not convinced. It was still Yun Cong persuaded, and the tree still returned to him, and he rewarded the place with one or two silver in another place. Thanks and thanks. Everyone said, after all, when the master is generous, when he shot, he talks about silver. That Lai Tieniu did not know what good luck had been paid, leaped on the fire, and walked with the master. I didn&rsquo;t know how much enjoyment was. Talking about it, not mentioned.  From Yun from looking for the ugly man, he sat alone on the broken tree and stared at him. Yun Cong called him approaching and entered the store. I used some force after the illness, and felt a little dizzy, and I didn&rsquo;t care at the time. Ordnest a full meal for the ugly man first. When asked about his name, he learned that the surname was not the surname Lai. When his mother became a daughter, she entered the mountains to pick wild vegetables. After three years, she returned to be pregnant. There was an old mother in the family who wanted to die. The neighbor saw that she was pregnant and ignored her. It is easy to be frustrated, and after another year and eight months, there is a wind. At the age of three or four, he grew up ten years old. He is very powerful, and he can catch up with tiger and leopard before the age of ten. If a man overwhelmed him, he would be half dead next to him. Fortunately, she was born to filial piety. Everyone was afraid of him and dared not bully his mother and son. Seeing that his mother did not protect the shortness, and saw that he was infinitely powerful, his thoughts were made, and he was not treated. He was originally a muddy jade, and he didn&rsquo;t know that everyone was abominable, hindering his mother&rsquo;s life, and still buried his head to practice. Sometimes he asked his mother: &quot;</p>
<p>How do you say that I have no father and is a beast. What is the reason?&rdquo; His mother cried as soon as he heard it, scaring him to ask again, from beginning to end. Later, his mother could not be bullied by everyone, and then he carried him, and lived at the foot of the east mountain of Tian silkworm. Both of the mother and son understand the transaction. At the time, the beasts he came from were all about to go, so from beginning to end, I did not know to change the beast to change money. Although the people in the village did not seem to be abominable in the first time the village, he also used him to say that everyone had given him an iron salamander and told him to fight the beast. Come, get some rough salt. Change the daily useless things. Sometimes his mother and child also have some self -use. After all, his mother suffered after all, and he would die, and he was urgent to ask for others everywhere. He had no money, and asked as a doctor, so he returned to the heal, and he was never cured. When he died, &quot;</p>
<p>your grandfather is a bear &hellip;&rdquo; The words were not over, and then swallowed. I said that there were no good people in the village before death. The mother was dead, but the mother was buried in the distance. She also lived with them and waited for them. The wooden board made a big material as the coffin seemed to see the coffin. Sheng Yan had a good corpse, tied the iron 镧 and all applications to the material, and did not find someone to help him. He held the bottom of the material and ran to the mountain. From Lingdong to Lingxi, after walking for two days, it was easy to find a beast cave, killing the beasts together, and buried the material. Three meals a day, crying while eating, and shouting mother. Because I first wounded the beast skin to scare people, guarding the dead mother&rsquo;s commandments, as soon as I didn&rsquo;t eat it, I was strong when I was out of the mountain. He can also eat or hungry. He knows that he is unable to get out of the mountain. In the past two months, the Silkworm Ridge beasts are scarce. After eating, seeing Yun Cong is still the same as before, only to ask him to question and answer, and I do n’t know what to do.  After Yun Cong asked him, the two households also came in with the place, and the rural people were honest and had no gossip. A group of four people got up together, arrived at Dabanqiao, and bought clothes for Shang Fengzi. Because of the delay, the sky is not too early, and it must be bright in the morning. The two households also said that there was something at home and had to leave back. Yun passed away from two or two silver for each person. From time to time, I feel uncomfortable. Shang Fengzi also said that he would go, Yun Cong asked him why, he said he would go back to see his mother. Yun Congcai cannot be resurrected by death. Life needs to do a career. You have to keep the tomb of the Lu&rsquo;s tomb in your life. Shang Fengzi suddenly realized that he insisted that he had to go back and spoke to his mother. Please go to Yun from the first way. As long as he said, he would catch up. Yun never stopped his filial piety, and he was afraid that he was dull. He chased his way tomorrow. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>Anyway, I can&rsquo;t get up today, that is, I can&rsquo;t get back. I will hit him tomorrow morning and hire a car and horse. Ask the way away. Fengzi said: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far away. I walked back and forth for more than ten a day, and there is still a delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Cong said to go with him. Fengzi heard the words of joy. Yun Congzhong associated with him. At the moment, I finished the store, Yifeng bought some food, took the clouds and wrapped it, and walked forward together. When there was no one, Yun wanted to try his feet and instructed to go quickly. Fengzi said: &ldquo;Can you catch up with brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Cong said it was okay. Fengzi smiled and ran forward. Shortly after Yun practiced his body, after the illness, he was born with a strangeness, and he worn the mountains like flying. He barely walked for one or twenty miles. He said that he couldn&rsquo;t support it. Fengzi also ran back and said, &ldquo;I said my brother couldn&rsquo;t catch up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Cong praised him for a few words, slowing down together.
After walking more than 20 miles, Yun became more and more sinister from seeing the mountain.</p>
<p>The sunset was behind the mountain.</p>
<p>The sky was dark and very ugly, so he asked how far it was.</p>
<p>Fengzi said: &ldquo;Just turn a mountain ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two said while walking, and they were about to arrive. After walking a valley, Fengzi was dark because of the darkness in the cave. I was not far away in front of me. Suddenly, I heard the cloud shouted from behind, &ldquo;What do you think of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fengzi heard the sound, turned back to see a color fog, and he was rolling back like Feiyun in the valley. Yun had shook two skewers and shouted dizzy, waiting for Fengzi to faint. Fengzi asked, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with his brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Cong couldn&rsquo;t speak with only his heart with his heart. The Fengzi was shocked, so he picked the clouds, ran back to the cave, and put it on it. The next day I could speak, saying that I walked through Tanou yesterday. When I saw that Guti Fei also rolled up a color fog, before it was near, I heard a strange fishy and fainted to the ground. Wait. Having said that, it is not saved. As a result, Yun was unconscious from the town, and Fengzi did not know the medical treatment. It was not until he met a Monk and Wei Chihuo that he rescued.  As soon as the Monk of Xiao heard Yun was a new disciple of the drunk Taoist, he said his origin. Yun Cong heard that he was more happy, and he was busy changing his brother. Speaking of hidden dangers in the family and the long time when you come out, we cry. The monk laughed: &ldquo;The younger brother should be sad. When you meet and my brother, the younger brother, you may wish to do anything. After you are sick, you have to raise it for several days. Yunyou, you are slow, you may not be able to meet if you go. He knows that there is such a hidden danger in your family. Slowly, he is proud of the door, that is, outsiders. Although the qualifications are good, they are born in the rich house of the beam. I am afraid that you will not get used to hard work, and you will specify that you will be able to suffer from some of them. Try your heart or not. Now But the first mind, that is, this one, has been promised, I am afraid that you will not rush to Chengdu, your family is already. For all, the two of me can fly to the sword. Go first. Narutukou&rsquo;s demon is shrouded, and you are poisoned nearby. There must be a monster such as the demon in it. It is not far from the climate to see that the spirit is not far from the climate. Do not ignore it, just take it out while it is unpopular, so as not to suffer. Otherwise, when it is born, there are no categories on the left hundred miles. &quot;</p>
<p>Thank you.  At that time, it was agreed that when Wei Chihuo went to Chengdu, he sought the same brother. He would use some silver road to use it. After eating porridge, I talked about each other. Shang Fengzi first saw that the captain Chi Huo was glory, flying through the air, and listening to the monk and saying many unusuals. Suddenly, he blessed his mind and begged the monk to teach him his ability. The monk said: &ldquo;Where can I send an apprentice, if you are attentive, and after you finish, use your natural qualifications, and you will not be able to include it. And wait for the younger brother Chi Chi to come back tomorrow, and talk about it after the demon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the time, the Monk of Xiao went outside the cave to watch the movement of the monster first. Shang Fengzi also followed. The Monk Monk gave Yun from taking a elixir and instructed to sleep before he came out of the same hole with Fengzi. At a high place, when Shang Fengzi saw that the darkness in the valley did not show any signs, he said to the monk: &ldquo;Brother Xiao is so far away, where can I see it, why not look forward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can see it. When it is clear, you can see the show. I can&rsquo;t break the origin of this monster. I will smell the smell here, and it will definitely be poisonous. Within two or three feet away from it, want to live alive. No wonder during the day, I can&rsquo;t laugh at the beast. I can already sacrifice the flying sword to remove it, but I still want to see what it is before it has been a climate. Seeing. You are loud, and you know it when you are young. If you have any moves, you must not step forward, everything must be listened to me. &ldquo;Then, then found a stone and sit down.  After staying for a while, I didn&rsquo;t feel the bouncing, and the heavens will see the dawn. When Fengzi saw that there was no movement, he wanted to speak, and the monk of laughing quickly ordered him with his hand. Fengzi felt numb and couldn&rsquo;t speak. It was amazing, and suddenly he heard a sharp strange sound from a distance, as if Yun called him from there. Looking at the laughing monk again, the trace is gone. The doubtful clouds have changed from something out. I want to go back to the cave to see it. Suddenly, the size of the fist in the valley was two strings of green fires, like a star in the first month, dancing for a while, and the fire dragon was collected in turn. I felt that someone touched myself, and couldn&rsquo;t help but say, &quot;</p>
<p>What is this?&rdquo; At the same time, he could move his hands and feet. Remember Yun Cong, he was about to go back to the hole. Someone stretched himself up and looked back.</p>
