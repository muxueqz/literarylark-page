    <h1>The 91st defeated the demon Mang Han stole the heavenly book before the sword of the heavenly pity</h1>
    <p>The 91st defeated the demon Mang Han stole the heavenly book before the sword of the heavenly pity  Wei Qing watched the five skeletons next to the three officials, and he was about to open his mouth to bite.</p>
<p>He listened to Ling Hun behind him and said, &ldquo;Wang Changzi quickly led his partner back! I still stay in this cow&rsquo;s nose!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, the five skeletons flew back together. Ling Hun had stood up from the ground, greeted him, took off his body and took off his body, exposing a white meat. The five skeletons stepped forward to surround Ling Hun, and opened Ling Hun to let go. At first sight, Wei Qing was not good, and she was not in time and danger. When she stepped forward, she wanted to reach out to grab a skeleton in the bite of Ling Hun&rsquo;s chest. Before the hand was approaching, I suddenly heard blood in my nose, dizzy for a while, and fell to the ground. Listening to a faint thunderous place in the nearby body, he heard Ling Hun&rsquo;s drink: &ldquo;Great son of Wang, you have been robbed for thirty -six years, and the white white generation is evil. Now I will save you, do you still wake up early?&rdquo;</p>
<p>, I heard a kind of sobbing. Wei Qing woke up and looked at it. Ling Hun sat on the stone beside him, holding a skeleton with both hands, the karma had disappeared from the fire. Looking at the three officials of Le, but lying on the front of the ground. Wei Qing remembered the sword, and quickly passed from Le San Guan. Because the ribs were shocked when the three officials were escaped by the three officials, I was afraid that he couldn&rsquo;t hold him on his belt. When he woke up when he was young, he would be escaped by him, and he was trying to kill him with a sword. Suddenly, when Ling Hun raised his hand, he flew over a colorful cable like a snake and fell beside him. At first glance, it was the ribs of the three officials who bundled the three officials of Le, and it was still not broken. Then he listened to Ling Hun&rsquo;s instructions and tied the three officials of Le. Wei Qing had to put the sword into the box, folded the three officials of Le, tied up like a sturdy, carrying it in front of Ling Hun, and asked Master how to deal with the demon path. Ling Hun didn&rsquo;t care about Wei Qing, but only murmured in the mouth of a skeleton held by Gu Chao&rsquo;s hand. At the end, I took a pill medicine from the body and stuffed it in the skeleton mouth, saying, &ldquo;Great son of Wang, you finally have a fate with me, you should have a life. Now I have given you the magic forbidden system and take Lingdan. At that time, I will take you to the body. Let&rsquo;s do it first. &quot;</p>
<p>Then, throw the skeleton in the air and shout,&rdquo; Start! &quot;</p>
<p>Fly in front, I didn&rsquo;t see it in the blink of an eye.  Wei Qing was standing next to Ling Hun with Le San Guan, and was seeing God. He suddenly saw Ling Hun stood up and looked at the empty. Seeing him, let him live for a few more years. &ldquo;Saying, recite the truth, and draw a few paintings to the four outside. Wei Qing didn&rsquo;t know what he was in trouble. When he asked, he saw a red cloud when he asked, and he saw a red cloud. As soon as it landed, a red -faced young child was appeared. There was a bunch of skeleton rosary beads hanging on the neck and two -hanging paper money. There was a golden building in his hand. There were red clouds around the fireworks around him, looking east and west, as if looking for something. Ling Hun is very close to that young child, and it seems that he never saw it. Wei Qing wanted to ask several times, and was blocked by Ling Hun. The red -faced young child looked around for a while, suddenly when he was furious, he drank his feet, turned into a red cloud, and rose into the air, flying straight to the southeast. Then he heard a rumbling sound from the distance, and it came from under the ground. Wei Qing still thought it was the sound of the magic array. If he didn&rsquo;t care, he asked Ling Hun to kill the three officials. Suddenly, Ling Hun said, &quot;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s too late, you go to the nest of the devil&rsquo;s nest.&rdquo; Then, said, he grabbed the three officials from Wei Qing&rsquo;s back and ran forward. Wei Qing shouted, &quot;</p>
<p>Master, take me together!&quot; Ling Hun had no shadow.  Wei Qing couldn&rsquo;t, stopped, and ran to a high place. Except for the quietness of Gekou, the remaining three aspects were red, green and fog, which permeated, and could not see any scene. At this time, the sound of wind and thunder and fire came out under the ground was more urgent than for a while. Wei Qing didn&rsquo;t know what the Magic Palace was, and had to follow the Avenue of the Valley to show his work hard. After walking a while, I heard a big thunderbolt pass, and there was a big shock in the sky. All the water, fire, fire and thunder were stopped, and the frying sounds of the rocks burst from a distance were mixed with a few yellow light and green light flying over the air. He was in a hurry, suddenly a gust of wind, a white light fell to the ground, a person showed a person, scattered his hair, and it seemed to have never been sorted out for many days, and his clothes were worn. Wei Qing stopped pressing the sword quickly, and the man first spoke: &quot;</p>
<p>Are you the land of the land Jinlong and Wei? The younger brother Yu Yunzhong, worshiped Master Ling Zhenren, took Master Cambodia, and came here to meet Brother Wei. Waiting for someone here. After the incident, I went to the Magic Cave, waiting for Master to drive, and then compared it. &ldquo;Wei Qing heard that the person was Yu Yunzhong, and he was happy in his heart, and he hurried forward to meet.  It turned out that Yu Yunzhong had forced soft fraud by the second strong monk of the monk Fan, to a small peak in front of the Qingluo. Xuefeng was cold, but fortunately, Bai Xin, who was given by the monk, returned to Yang Dan in his belly and could support it. On the seventh day, many fantasy scenes were found in front of Yunzhong. For the first time, I found some poisonous snakes and beasts. At first, Yunzhong was a little scared. However, except for both hands, his body had been restrained by the barbaric monk, and he could not rotate. When I saw those poisonous snakes and beasts roared up for a while, I suddenly disappeared. When I remembered, the monk said, I realized that these were illusions, so they settled their hearts. Yunzhong Gen was basically thick, and with the sake of being sought for, he simply set the life of life, condensed and calmly, and waited for the Fa to make the Fa. There are more days of sitting, and gradually from darkness. Although there is no master, there is already realization. Those illusions are getting worse and more horrible, and the more horrible, Yunzhongtong has not taken care of it.  After two seven, Ling Hun suddenly appeared. Yunzhong saw the strange flower that Dai Jiaxiu had seen. He knew that he was magnificent, and even Master Yuanqi and Yu Qing were very awe. He was happy and shouted, &quot;</p>
<p>The disciples were banned by spells, and they couldn&rsquo;t turn it. . &ldquo;Ling Hun said:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because I see you be sincere, the white dwarf is too very good, and you can take you as an apprentice. Because you are born in the house of Liang Fugui, I am afraid that you are unclean. Only then did you do the problem, and ordered you to steal the first level of the six magic. The monk Fan Gaocheng saw that you are still thick and your body. Then you use you as a substitute to practice the method of disintegrating this day. You have no Taoism, and this method will be difficult to get away, and it will be done with it. I have a very harsh choice because of the Emei apprentice, and the root line is not willing to include it. I can’t stand it. The foundation, dedicated to the unwilling aspirations of Emei, Xiu came to see with them. Seeing your ambitions and understanding, it is better to look out. There is a belief in the alchemy of the brutal monk. Unusual, he will hurt people more, although it is not invaded for the time being, it is a hidden danger, and you can no longer take it. You can hand over the rest and prepare for others. I will take a few more elixir for you. It can also help you to see your mind in the cold. You suffer here, and it is very easy to save you at this time. A magic array of a green snail will be launched in recent days. Two magic weapons. The deeds of the monk&rsquo;s cultivation can also emit water and fire wind. Therefore, the peak blue snails are right, and the Buddhist biography of Dafa is even worse than the blue snail demon array. , Save a lot of money. At the same time, borrowing the water and fire wind on both sides of the water and fire, the sky is excited, the Qingluo Valley will change, and it can be repaired. The Fa must sacrifice a life. You can&rsquo;t get out of the time. I will find a substitute for you to help you get rid of difficulties. A few days before Duanyang is the most important. At that time, what you appeared in front of you may not be an illusion. Shiman monk also comes here to help you deter look. I also hidden secretly, so I can do it. &ldquo;Say, take out the seven pills, and take it to take it. The self -confidence left by the Man Monk to Yunzhong will return to Yang Dan and go stealth. After Ling Hun left, Yunzhong was happy and shocked.  After more than many days, Sure enough, Vana Garin came, and saw that Yunzhong had no misunderstanding, and couldn&rsquo;t hold praise in his mouth. From this every three days, I found many evil ghost Yasha twice, and they were driven away by Vana Galin. One night, Duan Yangtou, Vana Galin II said to Yunzhong: &quot;</p>
<p>Tomorrow will make great achievements. I will do the law in the temple in the morning, and use King Kong to move the mountain and the eight devils at noon. At that time, if this small peak moves, you will be moved, you Do n’t be afraid, just determine this small salamander in the peak. When you arrive at the Qingluo, you will be 49 times in a row. After the incident, I will help you to make a way to report it for a while. &quot; , I taught the Yunzhong Fan Mantra, took out a small side of Xiaoman and Yunzhong, and repeatedly told it.
After the monk left, Yunzhong looked at him with many spells and forty -nine -nine influential skeletons.</p>
<p>When he was playing, when he saw Ling Hunfei, Yunzhong said to him, and asked him when he was in danger.</p>
<p>When Ling Hun met Nasaki, he laughed: &ldquo;The monk still wants to kill people, it is really abominable! He knows that there is also a water and fire in the magic formation of Tomorrow, and he is the rival of his ancestors in his past. The magic array, like listening to the words of the monk, will be able to exhibit 49 times in the peak head, although the people in the magic array are slightly higher in addition to the Dragon His Holiness and two or three Taoism, one can escape, but you also Will be ashes by Tian Lei. You don&rsquo;t care about him. At that time, I have my own reason. &quot;</p>
<p>Then, I took out a small sword friend and Yunzhong from my body:&rdquo; This sword is named Yulong, but that year, I practiced the way. The magic things have never met an enemy. After I am self -confident, I have used the flying sword. Tomorrow is Duanyang, not as good as your way. This sword is connected with my soul. Only cultivation can be applied. Pity you cultivation, temporarily borrow your application, wait for you to refine your sword yourself, and then return me. If you can work hard, you can not give you this sword, but at this time In addition, I will give you three runes and a Cambodian post. I also accepted a apprentice to call Wei Qing. Although you have never seen it, the two of you have known each other. Tomorrow I will leave the ground here to leave the ground here. When flying up, I will send you to the magic cave with the blow cloud method, meet Wei Qing on the road, and then act according to my Cambodian post. &quot;</p>
<p>Yunzhong heard the words and quickly nodded. Ling Hun passed on the method of using the sword and walked away. Yunzhong saw the sword of the sword with only three inches and six points, and the cold light was shot. Holding it in his hand, he was eager to move, as if he was going to fly away. Knowing that it is a treasure, very happy, I can&rsquo;t bear to show it in my hand.  In a blink of an eye, it was Tianming. Suddenly, I felt that physical activity was able to stand up. I guess that the monk believed in himself, and the industry had withdrawn the ban. I thought: &ldquo;Although Master would come to rescue when I was young, why not find a way to get away by myself, in case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he tried to find the road of Xiafeng. Who knows what you can go, you can only be within the three -year -old circle. After this, you can&rsquo;t get up. It was learned that although the Man Monk withdrew from the prohibition, there was still a spell block in the four outside. After sitting for many days, and the movement of the legs and feet, and waiting for Master to come, then made a sealing plan.  Time is easy to pass, and I don&rsquo;t feel the turn of Chen Yan. Looking at the valley in front of it, I saw many Tao Guanghua moved and knew that the two karma had played against each other. After a while, the sound of the wind and thunder and fire came from the distance. At the beginning of the day, the light was at the beginning of the peak, and at the same time, there was a fire on the peak, and at the same time, the peaks were full of thick fog, and the steamer was booming. In the fog shadow, gradually felt that the peaks were shaking, and it seemed to rise up. There was a strong wind at the bottom of the ground, and there was a sound of water over the wind, the surging call sign, and the sound of the previous wind sounded, and it was even more amazing. Then there was a thunderous sound from the side of Zhaoyuan Temple, and at the foot of the peak, there was a bombing. The sound of frying, the sound of water, fire, and thunder were launched together, and the peak gradually rose up. Yunzhong could not see the sunlight in the dense fog. I do n’t know that the sky had paid noon, but I felt that the peak rose higher and higher. The timing industry is urgent, and Ling Hun hasn&rsquo;t seen it yet. It was suspicion, and Mengjue Nafeng rotated in the air. After a while, getting more and more troubles, the sound of water, fire, and thunder are getting tighter, and I don&rsquo;t know how much turning. Suddenly, a big shock passed, and the peak turned around and flew forward. Yunzhong was dizzy by these giant sounds, holding the small sacrifice given by the monk with one hand, holding the Yulong Sword with one hand. In the panic, a flash of flashed in front of him, a golden light passed, and only felt that Xiao Yan was taken away in his hands, and he seemed to be hanging in the air. I heard Ling Hun&rsquo;s voice saying: &ldquo;I have found you on behalf of you, and send you to the magic cave with a cloud method. When you see Wei Qing on the road, you can go on and follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Listen, then then Jue Shenzhi is clear. Opening his eyes and seeing it, it really was no longer on Xiaofeng, and his body seemed to be flying in the air. Looking at it again, the Xiaofengye had been hanging hundreds of feet, and the fire in front of the peak was a hundred feet Hong Tao fire, and the sound of the wind was like a silver dragon and a fire dragon. I am afraid that I would lose my feet and looked at it slightly, and then stared at the flying below. After a while, I flew into the Qingluo Valley. Not far away, I saw a big man walking below. I wonder if the person was Wei Qing. The heart was only moved, and suddenly landed. Ask recently, the fruit is Wei Qing. The two found a secluded place, opened the Cambodian post given by Ling Hun, and read: &ldquo;Now the magic formation has been broken by the Dafa of Dafa by the monk Fan Jiayin, and the monk monk dies died. A lot of. The throne of the Magic Cave is connected to the hole, which contains the heavenly books and elixirs of Qiu Weifeng. Sacred one by one with the tactics of the biography, divided into Wei Qing, and then rushed to the magic cave. There is a demon law of the demon law, and you must not be good. You must wait for someone in the eight magic to come back to the ground. The book supply is within the stone cave that is connected to the hole. It is equipped with a jade box. When entering the cave, you can grab the book in front of the magic cub and take the book. You and Wei Qing are carefully holding. Just act boldly. When you go out of the hole, if you meet a dwarf man, this person is the Tibetan spiritual son on the banks of the Chaidama River in Yunnan. The stealth method must be concealed. If you don&rsquo;t let go, he won&rsquo;t come to take it. In case of the abnormalities, Wei Qing can say that he worshiped his grandmother Sai Fei Qiong to come here to steal the book, ask him to raise his hand, and he will go. After getting the heavenly book, I waited for me in the magic cave, and there was another distribution. &quot;</p>
<p>After reading the Cambodian posts, Yunzhong and Wei Qing did it. Look at the three spiritual symbols. The first one is different from the other two. Yunzhong took the first one and raised the tactics in his hand. Suddenly, a golden light flashed in front of him, and the two felt that they flew up. After a while, let&rsquo;s take a look at it, and it has fallen in a palace. There are more than a dozen monks on the inside and outside of the hall. Come down. Yunzhong and Wei Qing knew the mana, because they didn&rsquo;t know who these people were eight magic, they were going to listen to them. Suddenly there was a sound of breaking the air. A yellow light in the courtyard appeared in the middle of the courtyard. Two Taoist priests with a fierce appearance and a strange look, panicked to the hall. Earlier dozens of individuals came forward to welcome salutes. Someone asked, &ldquo;The sound of the landslide was heard, and the two demon owners returned to the palace, presumably a lot of victory?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two Taoist priests did not say anything. Waiting, if you meet the enemy, come forward quickly, and let him come in. The crowd led and coaxed, and they went out. The two Taoist priests were high and short, and the height was the big magic Huang Yan. After the two of him waited for his men to leave, Huang Yan yelled at Li: &ldquo;Six brothers, they can&rsquo;t think of being so bad today. The two brothers and eight brothers are closest to the magic array, and the karma is shocked by Lei Huo. After serious injuries and escaped, I did n’t see back to the palace at this time. Mo Bu survived. The third brother did not know where to escape. Definitely I saw the opportunity, you were far away, and there was no injury. Now the general trend has gone, I do n’t know if the ancestor and Xu Xiangu have any other magical ways to save the disorders. . If the two of him cannot support and the enemy chases, the foundation industry must not be kept. It is the heavenly book I remembered in the stone cave. According to Master ’s when he was in the year, the book was divided into three letters of the middle and lower, and in addition There is a volume of sideline. Except for the person who can understand the auxiliary rolling Taoism, only the letter of the text is not only written. I do n’t know who it is so far. Because the letter from the second old man in Songshan, because there was no letter, it was difficult to be well -known. Thanks to Emei ’s ancestor&rsquo;s long eyebrows, the legend was only half. . Because of the treasure of the Book of Heaven, she is not easy to carry. She hides it in a stone cave under the throne. It can be blocked with a sub -roll on the outside. After passing me to the Fa alone. Master also said that he can get all the three heavenly books. As long as you are proficient in this letter, you can be extraordinary to be sanctified and deeply involved. By worshiping the door of the Dragon Dragon, I wanted to give it out. Because I saw Brother Yu&rsquo;s arrogance and self -esteem, I slightly existed with a little prevention, and I might be cheaper. I waited for eight brothers. I love you the most. Straight, unlike the three brothers and seven brothers, it is likely to be taken away by the enemy. Although they can&rsquo;t take out this book, it is not easy for me to wait for the other day. Only then did you come to you quietly. Please look at the four girls outside. If you see a lot of good luck in front, come and report to the letter. I will take out the heavenly book with you, fled to the deep mountains, find an ancient hole, and search for the trace of the letter to the sky. Find the experts who know the book of the sky, worship the spells under his door, and then make a revenge. Isn&rsquo;t it good? &quot;</p>
<p>The words were right, and suddenly a yellow light flew into the temple, walked around, and still flew outside.</p>
<p>Huang Yan was panicked: &ldquo;The four sisters showed the sword light, and the big things must be bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, hurriedly opened the throne of the hall in a hurry, and passed the spells. , Fall in both hands. After turning nine times, there was a sound of the bottom of the ground, a green smoke rushed, and immediately showed a hole. Yunzhong and Wei Qing secretly pulled each other, and followed Huang and Li to walk to the hole. There are dozens of feet in the person, and a stone gate appears to be painted on it. Huang Yan walked away from the door of the cave, and he was busy calling Li Roar to stop. After finishing the curse, there was a spark on the stone gate. With a sound, Shimen was naturally open. Yunzhong saw Li and Huang Ermao still turned there, and it was not negligent. He pulled Wei Qing and looked at it from the oblique thorns. It was full of golden light. Three inches wide, inch, high -profile jade box. Wei Qing quickly grabbed and hugged in her arms, and ran out of Tongyun Zhong. The cave door was small, and when Huang and Li Er Mo walked in, they hit a full. The first was that Li Roz was walking in to the stone cave. He was hit by people, but he couldn&rsquo;t see a trace. He just shouted: &ldquo;There is a spy in the cave, the elder brother pays attention!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And pass. As soon as he shouted, Yunzhong remembered: &ldquo;The high volume of the talent calls him six brothers. Could he be the six magic roar? Just happen. &quot;</p>
<p>Thinking of this, using Yulongjian in his hand, a white light passed, and he shouted. As soon as the big magic Huang Yan heard the six devil&rsquo;s roar, he saw a white light passing by. He suddenly heard the tragic roar, only shouted half -cut, and then the blood rose, and his head landed. Knowing bad, busy sacrificing the flying sword to protect the body and recite the magic magic spell. When I ran into the cave, the Bao Guang on the stone case was eliminated, and the Tianshu of the jade box was gone. I am afraid that someone will be secretly calculated, and they will come out quickly. Wei Qing hugged the sky with both hands, and saw that Yunzhong took the first level of Li&rsquo;s roar. He also wanted to take advantage of it. Unexpectedly, the enemy aircraft police escaped and had to go out of the stone cave with Yunzhong.  As soon as I arrived at the hall, I saw a dwarf man standing there. The big magic Huang Yan stood behind the Tao, such as clay sculpture woodcarving. The two were one tall and one short, and the person was only three feet long, and the belly of only Huang Yan was more fierce in the same way. Seeing that the person in Yunzhong, although the person was short, he was full of people, his appearance was clear, his chest fluttered, his back was inserted with a long sword, wearing an apricot -yellow robe, barefooted shoe, he was blocking his own. Go to the road. Thinking of Master Ling&rsquo;s Cambodian post, he knew that this person was Tibetan Lingzi. It was about to quietly pull Wei Qing to stop, walking around from the side, but Wei Qing stood up, thinking that there was a Ling Hun&rsquo;s spiritual symbol, forgetting the words on the Cambodian post, hugging the jade box with one hand, and pulling out the one with one hand to follow the three officials from Le San Guan. The sword in my hand stabbed forward. Yunzhong didn&rsquo;t hold it, and shouted, &ldquo;Brother Wei forgot to make his grandmother&rsquo;s death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wei Qing heard the words, and remembered what Master Cambodia said. It was said that Wei Qing felt that something he was heavy in his hand was beaten. Looking at the hand, the tiger mouth industry has shocked, and blood flows. More and more knowing that the Taoist is powerful, it really can&rsquo;t hide him. I had to hug the jade box with both hands, and I couldn&rsquo;t even care about the sword, and wanted to go out from the side of the Taoist. Who knew that in one step, the man rubbed his hands twice and raised it towards Yunzhong and Wei Qing, and immediately stopped the road on the upper and lower sides of the hall. Wei Qing was eagerly forgotten to post the words on the post. In front of the Taoist, Yunzhong was inconvenient to say. In a hurry, a blue light was stunned, and he went into the temple like Changhong. A Taoist child with a tall and tall figure appeared on the ground. When he saw this person, he bowed to him: &ldquo;The disciples are ordered to use it. Master&rsquo;s red wanted bag was sent back to Chandama to imprisonment, waiting for Master to go back to control, and he would come to life. &quot;</p>
<p>Then, the man didn&rsquo;t say anything, only he pointed at Wei Qing. The child turned around and drank it towards Wei Qing: &ldquo;You stupid man, present the jade box Tianshu! My master is compassionate and never hurts you. I want to be poisoned. &quot;</p>
<p>Wei Qing&rsquo;s grandmother&rsquo;s family surnamed Bear. The former and Tibetan Lingzi had a very long cause and effect. After this section, there are other explanations, let&rsquo;s not mention it for the time being.  At this time, the fire had been burned to Yunzhong and Wei Qing, and burned his clothes. In horror, Wei Qing listened to the child who claimed to be a bear blood, and reminded Wei Qing in a word and remembered the words on the Cambodian post. The fire burning was in critical condition, and he quickly bowed towards the Taoist: &ldquo;My Wei Qing worshiped my grandmother Sai Fei Qiong, and came here to return the heavenly book. I passed. &quot;</p>
<p>The man heard that, with a surprise, he moved his hand, and flew back in the fire immediately, disappearing the fire. The man hadn&rsquo;t spoken and looked at the child. That child came over and asked Wei Qing, &ldquo;My master asked you, your grandmother has been dead for many years, and it is not too old to see you. How can you remember your grandmother when he died?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t say detail, anxious for Wei Qing. Wei Qing suddenly blessed his soul and replied: &ldquo;My grandmother was in Dinghu Peak to compare the sword, and she was hit by the enemy&rsquo;s hidden weapon. It took decades to sit down for decades. At that time, I was only four years old and I already knew some personnel. My grandmother left my father and ordered my father to steal the heavenly book here. Famous teachers, steal again. At the age of seven, my father was killed by another enemy. Heavenly books were not stolen. I was young at the time. I visited the name of the enemy for many years. At the time of drawing, I came here. I wanted to steal the book of the Tianshu first, after making it into it, and then to find the two generations of enemies to get revenge. You can hardly take it away, and I will spend my efforts. &quot;</p>
<p>The child moved his mouth a few times. The child said to Wei Qing again: &ldquo;My Master is not like to bullish softness, knowing that you are the apprentice named Hua Linghun, and what you say is not a word. Then you kill your grandmother Sai Fei Qiong&rsquo;s enemies. It is the Master of the Eight Magic Master here than Qiu Weifeng. My Master will take revenge for your grandmother several times. One has not been killed for more than 50 years, and it is inconvenient to get rid of her. Without a chance, her number of Qi was not exhausted. In the past few years, she was killed in Chengdu. She was chopped by a flying sword with a flying sword by the Emei lady. Your father is the ancestor of Huashan Pai Lie Fire. In the future, you can practice the Heavenly Book, and then go to find him to settle the account. My master reads it in your grandmother. The Chinese demon method is suitable to kill the body. Fortunately, your master blames him that he has obtained the letter, and there are two letters of the middle and lower letters. Master ordered you to work hard to cultivate it. In the future, he will help you. My brother and teacher Wen Gong was injured by a white eyebrow needle with a white eyebrow needle. He was not fatal, and was killed by the poisonous dragon evil friend green robe thief. When my master and apprentice were looking for revenge, he had a time to take care of his noses to avoid inconvenience of each other. &quot;</p>
<p>Said, he waved his hand, the temple was gone back, and a blue light was on the hall. The master and apprentice even disappeared.
It turned out that Wei Qing was the grandson of the south of the Shu Nan, the son of Wei Quan, the immortal.</p>
<p>Weida&rsquo;s wife, Sai Fei Qiongxiong Miangniang, is one of the three daughters of the unknown female heroes.</p>
<p>Manniang is second in the three daughters of the Shan Shan.</p>
<p>The two of the two are Hengshan Jinyu Luo Ziyan, and the other is the Xianxian Xianzi Nine Sister.</p>
<p>At that time, the three agreed not to marry someone, and worshiped the seven -finger of the Dragon Mother to study swordsmanship under the door of the air division at the Xuan Nu Temple of Minama.</p>
<p>Due to the teachings of the air division, the disciples who received were less than ten years and could not be distributed.</p>
<p>For less than four years of practicing the three, I just practiced the swordsmanship with some paths.</p>
<p>Because the empty division suddenly realized the opportunity in the quietness, he regularly passed away.</p>
<p>Taoist.</p>
<p>Luo Ziyan obtained &ldquo;Yue Girl Sutra&rdquo;</p>
<p>, Xiao Jiumei got a &ldquo;Sanyuan Secret&rdquo;</p>
<p>, and only Manniang did not teach anything. At this time, Man Niang was the most diligent in hard work, and the qualifications were the best. Seeing that Master was coming, everyone else had taught. She had nothing to do. Slowly, she was resentful. Lian Luo and Xiao also felt that Master was too thin to Man Niang. The three of her three were in love, and Luo and Xiao helped her kneel. Because the aircraft division was sitting meditating, he was soaring when he was auspicious, and even ignored it. The three begged for a long time. Seeing that the time was approaching, Manniang was crying and tears. Because the flight attendant sighed too much, he said, &ldquo;When you arrive in my door, you know that you love yourself and have no morality. Why do I not have a farewell to you alone? There are many causes and effects in this. OK to go back, those who love you are enough to harm you. Three of your sisters and sisters. Although Manniang is more advanced, she has not broken her. At this time Although it is difficult to participate in the positive fruit, the couple can enjoy the old age, and the old age is old. Otherwise, the injustice will be tangled halfway, and there will be no good results, so you are not willing to teach. I really have eccentricity. Nowadays, I have gathered for a long time, and I leave eight slang words for Manniang, two Cambodian posts, indicating the opening of the year outside. Can&rsquo;t be revealed, Xielai complains me. If you can avoid the injustice in the first bundle post, you can avoid the second Cambodian post. If you are unjust, you must act according to the second Cambodian post, and you must have the worries of life. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he ordered the pens of the Niangniang to pick up the two Cambodian posts and packed it in the bag. good. Leave eight sentences. The three were not at the same time. Because the aircraft division had the nasal nose, the two lines of jade bands had been dangled and sat down. The three of them were very sorrowful. The contract will still live in the temple due to the finish of the Emperor ’s Normal University. When Manniang saw the slang, he wrote: &ldquo;When you meet Wei Tong, you can&rsquo;t enter every cave. Dinghu Dragon goes, Shishi Tianzong. Dan Feng shines, and the magic nails are cut into bones. After that, with Luo and Xiao, they took a look at them for a while.  The three lived in the temple for two years. The Miang Niang saw that Luo and Xiao each were taught by Taoism taught by the empty division, and they were more refined every day. Look at the previous date of Cambodian posts, and there are still three years before the opening date. Because Master ordered, he couldn&rsquo;t show the words before the date was opened. In addition, Luo and Xiao Xiaoli made great efforts. They could not always find the two to talk about the two. They were boring in their spare time and thoughtfully, and they wanted to go down the mountain to play. The two people in Luo and Xiao were waiting for it, and they were all settled. Man Niang did not notify the two. She left the book from one person, left the Xuan Nu Temple alone, got off the mountains, and visited the landscape everywhere. Once I went from Sichuan to Yungui, I met a girlfriend who hadn&rsquo;t seen him for many years at the Lake of Kunming. Talking about Dinghu Peak next to Xiandu Mountain, Zhejiang, Zhejiang, a new demon dragon was nearly emerged, which was very rampant. Manniang has heard Dinghu Peak in the middle of Xiandu, and the two mountains, standing in Xun, four without climbing, except for those who have the Tao, mortals want to go up. There is a lake at the top of the peak, named Dinghu, which is the place where the Huangdi is ascended and the name of Dinghu Peak is from this. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>I have nothing to do with it. Why not take a look at the sacrament of the Huangdi ascending immortality? It is also a merit to remove the demon dragon.&rdquo; Thinking of this, I would like to do that my girlfriend, and the turning road march into Zhejiang to march to Zhejiang. Essence  On this day, the Xianxialing at the junction of Fujian and Zhejiang, the peak was across the junction of Fujian and Zhejiang, and it was connected to Jiangxi. Fourth -fifths of the mountains belong to Zhejiang, and one -fifth is under the jurisdiction of Fujian. There are many fairy cave houses in the mountains and valleys in the mountains. Man Niang passed Xianxia Pass, in the autumn and deep sun, the maple and the maple Lin Yingzi, competing with Yu Xia. The empty mountains were silent, the four unmanned sounds, when the spring sounded, and the sang with the tired birds of returning to the forest. Mang Niang suddenly wanted to take some spring water to drink, but only listened to the sound of the spring, and without seeing the water, she walked forward. After turning two rock horns, I hadn&rsquo;t seen the streams, and I walked forward for a while. Manniang was curious. I was afraid that there was something in the grass in the grass, so she took out the sword and opened the cluster of the wild grass. It turned out that there was a snake and a big turtle in it. At this time, although Mang Niang&rsquo;s swordsmanship did not practice with the sword, the flight was extinct, but the sword had been able to collect it, and took the first level to ten miles away. This turtle and snake that has not yet been made into a climate can be affordable. The dial of Manniang&rsquo;s inadvertently has cut the heads of the turtle and snake on the ground. Because the snake was a red -haired poisonous snake, she was happy to remove harm and did not care. She still went to find the source of the spring. After a few steps, I felt a little sleepy, my thoughts were stunned, my heart was very quiet, and I couldn&rsquo;t find a secluded place to sleep.  I was thinking, and I suddenly saw that the blue light in the forest flashed there. Looking forward quietly, the blue light was like a dragon and snake, and it was gently retreat from the forest. Man was reluctant to follow the forest, and saw a cliff hole on the face. As soon as the blue light fell to the ground, a seven or eight -inch naked villain appeared and ran into the cave. Man Niang guessed that Jin Dan, who was refined by the elves in the deep mountain, was willing to let it go. I may escape from the stuff, the screen gas is condensed, and my feet are covered with my hands. Looking inside, the cliff cave was only deep in Xu Fangyuan, and there was no retreat. The cave is on the middle of the pantone, and a small Taoist with a five -willow and clear eyebrows sitting is less than three feet tall. At this time, the villain in the blue light had flown to the top of the Taoist head, and a white smoke appeared on the door of the Taoist life, and he absorbed the villain into the door of his life. Although Manniang saw that man was generally the same as people, she was so thin that she was thin, and the situation of the villain they saw was different from that of ordinary monks. Unfortunately, he was one step late and was escaped by the villain back to the nest. Looking at the Taoist again, he was still unable to wake up, and he could not help but get up again. It was intended to cover the Panshi of the Taoist meditation. When his Yuanshen appeared twice, he moved his body away, so that the villain fascinated the way back, and he could not return to his body. To take it. When the idea was determined, while the Taoist was closed, he covered him gently, and the joy of the Taoist did not notice it at all. I ambushed for a while in the back of the stone. It was a little impatient, and he heard a sound of the Taoist head, and a white smoke emerged. The villain appeared in the second time from the Taoist Mingmen, turning the Tao Qingguang, and still flew outside. Man Niang counted the villain to go far, so he got up and walked to the front. The more he looked at the shape of the person, the more suspicious. Man Niangyi is very bold, and she hasn&rsquo;t gained it and interests. She pulled out her sword in case in case, stretched out her left hand, and wanted to hold the Taoist body and hide it elsewhere. First thought that the man was short, and he didn&rsquo;t stab, and he didn&rsquo;t work very much. It was a bit surprising until the Taoist was not pinched. The one -arm was held again, and the Taoist was still sitting there, and he hadn&rsquo;t moved. As a result of the nature of the mother, not only did she retreat, but the anti -general sword returned the box, inserting her hands into the Taoist threatening, and using the power of life to mention it, it was still like a dragon&rsquo;s shocking stone pillar. I was planning to mention it again, and suddenly seeing the glaeling back of my head, I quickly turned around and looked at it. Mang Niang suddenly moved her heart, hurriedly gave up the Taoist, and pulled out the sword in the box to greeze and went forward, trying to catch the villain. When the villain saw that Man Niang welcomed his sword, he did not avoid, and greeted the blue light in the back, flying away from the man of Man Niang, and felt the cold. Man Niang knew that she was not good. She was busy with a bite, raised her hand, and turned into a Bai Guangfei out of her hand. I saw that the flying sword and the blue light were twisted, and I felt a sense of feelings for a while. In the confusion, I seemed to be hugged by people. In the moment, my body was sour, and my body was numb from the soles of my feet, and I lost my consciousness.
When I woke up, I felt comfortable and my head was a little soft, like drunk.</p>
<p>The dwarf man stood beside him sadly and looked at himself.</p>
<p>The mountains and the mountains are full of mountains, and the industry has been in the early morning of the next day.</p>
<p>Man Niang thought about the situation in the dream, knowing that she was in the dark, ashamed and angry, and did not speak.</p>
<p>The man took his hand and accepted the Man Niang Flying Sword.</p>
<p>Man Niang knew herself, and she was afraid that she was insulted again for the second time.</p>
<p>She did not dare to step forward.</p>
<p>She had a tears in her eyes and hit the rocks.</p>
<p>She intends to find himself.</p>
<p>Who knew that if someone was pulling like someone, he tried his best to break away.</p>
<p>If you want to escape again, it is still difficult to move.</p>
<p>When she seemed to be able to live, she could not die, and she hated the injustice more and more, and pointed at the Taoist to scold.</p>
<p>The man didn&rsquo;t say it.</p>
<p>When Manniang scolded exhaustedly, he approached, and said to Manniang, &ldquo;Girl Xiong is angry. You open your master&rsquo;s Cambodian post and know the cause and effect of this. . &quot;</p>
<p>Man Niang heard a surprise:&rdquo; Thief, monster, do you dare to peek at my master&rsquo;s Cambodian post? &quot;</p>
<p>The humanity:&rdquo; I had to see your master&rsquo;s Cambodian post earlier, but it would not cause people to harm people and harm it. I have made a lot of mistakes in this thousand years. After I did something wrong, I regretted it very much. I wanted to know the origin of your famous surname, thinking that the place where the sin was at all day looked at the words on the Cambodian post with the perspective method. &quot;</p>
<p>Manniang knew that she was anxious, and quickly took out the Cambodian post. First look at the opening year written on the first Cambodian post. Because of the past two years, I have been traveling abroad and unknowingly mixing time. I still have a fast date a few days ago. Can&rsquo;t help but happy and excellent, open your hands on your hands and look closely. The above reads: &ldquo;The evil fate of Ru this world is not exhausted, it is difficult to correct the fruit, and the aunt is sincere. For this reason, the person intends to win the sky, reserve the exposure to the future. When this Cambodia is issued, you will be in front of Xianxia Pass and encounter it by mistake. The monk Tibetan of the Peacock Qinghe on the Yunnan Peacock Qinghe, but a section of a public case fifty years ago. If you can avoid this robbery, next year, Chongyang Day will open the second Cambodian post, when you show the fate of the world. Otherwise, you will encounter a bear. The surname is a teenager. After finishing marriage, the husband and wife enjoy the age of cultivation. If you want to return to the fruit, you have to go to the world. You lose Yuan Yin, which is because of the evil. Tibetan Lingzi, the previous life of only one of the Midama River washing Fan Fan&rsquo;s Er, can not arrive in this life, let alone the afterlife. From then on, hard work is good. On the month, leaving a disciple Xiong Manniang. Master is empty. &quot;</p>
<p>Man Niang read the Cambodian post, thinking that Master had a word&rdquo; in the cave &quot;</p>
<p>, hating that she should not have a lot of care, and she was defeated and humiliated. He couldn&rsquo;t help crying again.  Tibetan Lingzi sighed: &ldquo;Man Niang was sad, and please sit down. To let me say that your previous cause and effect, you know what the evil fate said in the empty master Tai Cambodia. My mother was originally a family of Gansu. The rich daughter, because of her parents entering the Yunnan Buddha, was robbed by my father to the inside of Tianling Mountain to force it to become a relative. My grandparents were very good in martial arts. When I saw that my daughter was robbed, I invited many capable people to kill my father. , Save my mother. Although my mother and my father had only been married for a few days, they were pregnant. After returning home, because they had lost their bodies, they were determined not to marry someone. The grandfather was quite right. There is a side room, so I support it. My mother can&rsquo;t stand her suffering. I want to give birth to a half daughter first, and I can have an hope. Who knows that this pregnancy is pregnant for one year and six months before giving birth. I go down to the ground. In the season, there is a long white hairy in the body. It is only five or six inches from head to toe. It is not like a human form. When my mother saw it, at the time, the breath passed out, and the postpartum disorders were added. He died. Grandfather and his side room, said that I was a monster bone blood. As soon as my mother died, I ordered someone to hold me out. I never died, and I drilled out of the soil on the seventh day. It was also a fairy. I just walked through my teacher Qinghai&rsquo;s originator, Jiang Zhenren, and heard the children crying in the grave, and saved me to the Chandama River. Because flying is as soon as he is, although there are many disciples under the door, no one is enough to inherit the Taoism. Seeing that my roots are unusual, I am very happy to delay me for 20 years. When I was ascending, I called me alone, saying that although my foundation was good, but unfortunately my father was genetically genet, and the root of the sin was not broken. Sooner or later, I was defeated. Lisuction. I always pay attention to Master&rsquo;s words, and I have always been paying attention to the rules of the door. After 30 years, one day I walked on the Chaidama River to spare time and saw a poor family. There was only a little girl who was only three or four years old It is very beautiful and cute. From time to time, I give her money and rice food, but she loves children, and it is not intentional. The girl is very willing to ask me to hold her to make fun. The girl grows up with me again. People in the area in that area are like my gods. There are both Buddhism and Taoism, and they can&rsquo;t help but marry their wives. Her parents are benefited by me and want to marry this girl several times. This girl I am also very willing. Of course, I refused to meet the girl. The girl died from the disease of Acacia. On the third day after her death, a young shepherd child who was eighteen or nineteen suddenly raised himself in her. In front of the tomb. At that time, because I was afraid that the girl was entangled with me, I was traveling outside. When I came back and asked about it, I realized that the girl fell in love with me, but the shepherd fell in love with her. Unfortunately, I went back for two months. The bones of the two were dead and could not return to the soul. I have been hiding in my chest for many years. Because I heard that Xianxialing has recently produced many formal elixir and came to take it. These elixirs are already psychic, very alert, and it is difficult to get it. I have been here for many days, and I use the Yuanshen to go to find it every day. I do n’t want you to track this. At first I saw you running, and I didn&rsquo;t want to do much. If you don&rsquo;t understand the matter, you think it&rsquo;s not good for me. I see you studying swordsmanship, and even the most famous Sanxian, Erlai, Yizi, and Seven True shapes are not inquiring. Others are okay. However, the appearance of my Tibetan Lingzi is the most strange. There is no second person in the world that there is a second person who looks like me. You will not know. At first, I was good intentions, and I wanted to take this to alert you. Unexpectedly, you cut turtles and snakes in front of you, and the sword was stained with the kinky of the world and the earth. Both couldn&rsquo;t hold it for a while before making these mistakes. At this point, you are not helpful. According to my opinions, you might as well act as the flight attendant Tai Cambodia post. If you are useful, I will do my best to help each other. &quot;</p>
<p>Man Niang was persuaded by Tibetan Lingzi. Although she dispelled her death, she thought that her career had lost her body, and Tibetan Lingzi was a high -profile person. Thinking of this, I couldn&rsquo;t help blushing, and I was embarrassed to speak in person. It was embarrassing, and Tibetan Lingzi had seen her heart, and was afraid that she was entangled here. She had to think of a plan: I lied to Man Niang to take a grain of forgetting Dan, secretly chanting the cursing, and waiting for Manniang to be in a coma. , I went to it. After Mang Niang served to forget Dan, she felt fell asleep with her eyes, and she fell asleep on the stone for a while. When I woke up, I saw a Cambodian post in my hand with a Cambodian post in my hand. At this time, Manniang had a spell of Tibetan Lingzi, and forgot the talents. I only remember that she was cutting the turtles and snakes, so she felt softly sleeping. Get up, I don&rsquo;t feel strange on my body. At first glance on the Cambodian post, it was the date of opening that day, and the trace of the above could not be solved. I also thought: &ldquo;Who is this Tibetan spiritual? According to the Cambodian post, I still have a evil relationship with him. How do I have not met before watching Cambodia? Can that surname bears get Tao? &quot;</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I was happy, but I didn&rsquo;t know that the karma had already won the Tao of others. When I got up, I went out of the clothes and went to Dinghu Peak. When I walked out of the forest in front, I was not far from the turtle and snake, and I saw the clusters of the wild grass shaking again. I thought: &ldquo;Is there anything strange to hidden here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I just walked forward for more than ten steps. I suddenly heard the rumors and fluttered in the grass, and jumped out of a dark, high -talented villain, There were two green green leaves on his shoulders. When he saw Manniang, he flew forward.
Mang Niang was aware of Xichi, and when she heard that the grass was in the grass again, the probe saw that it was the big turtle who had been cut off and turned around.</p>
<p>The dead snake industry was unknown, and only the first -line snake seal appeared in the mud.</p>
<p>Because the turtle did not hurt people, she was waiting to find the trace of the poisonous snake.</p>
<p>She thought: &ldquo;I have heard Master said before that there are often fairy grass such as meat and Shouwu in deep mountains. If you can get it, you can grow up. If you can see that villain, is it for the such as the meat. This turtle and the snake have the aura of it, so can you get back to life? &quot;</p>
<p>Thinking of this, you can no longer look at the turtles, snakes, life and death , Look at the direction where the black villain escapes. Although the little man moved quickly, his legs were short, and he hadn&rsquo;t ran far away. He gave up turtles and snakes and chased forward. After chasing the two hillside, it was not far apart. The villain looked back and saw Man Niang chased, and made a squeak in her mouth, and Yifa flew forward. Running around and running another hillside, the villain suddenly got into a cluster of grass, and then disappeared. At a glance in the grass in the grass, the grass elsewhere is yellow, but the grass here is very green and green. The more he guess it is the place where the elixir grows, so he speculates that the villain jumps and looks forward. Finding the center of the grass, I saw that there were three feet in the grass in the grass to see a circle of open space. Man Niang couldn&rsquo;t help but blocked, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were not yet, and a blue green grass next to Blackzhi suddenly drilled into the ground. Manniang was anxious, and she didn&rsquo;t grab her forward, and she only teared the half of the green leaves. Seeing that the green grass was not in the soil, it disappeared. Look at this half of the green leaves in your hand, shaped like a lotus petal, large on the top, small underneath, it is really green. Although unknown names can change, it is undoubtedly fairy grass. Regret should not be alarmed, and it was taken away by it. And Xixi, the ganoderma was still there, lest it like that green grass, and quietly moved to the front, and collected half a piece of green leaves in his arms. One hand grasped the near the root first, and the sword was unbuttoned, and the fear of the sword hurt it. He only used the sword box to dig the soil around that. Digging it with three or four feet, gradually showing a villain head, more and more careful. After a while, the whole body was available. Sure enough, a villain was attached to the roots of the blackzer. Everything was generally the same as people, but only the color was green, and it was not as dark as before. Man Niang thought that it was easy to look wrong, she didn&rsquo;t have time to think, the elixir was very happy, and she was so happy. This black Zhizhi body has five feet long, and the black is green and green, which looks very beautiful. Manniang was holding her hands and was happy, and listened to her. Looking back, behind him, he was undulating like waves. There was a red line, and a black thing was riding a black thing on the red line.</p>
