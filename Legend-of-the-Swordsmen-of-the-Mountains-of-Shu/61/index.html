    <h1>The sixties of the sixtieth Xiangjiang River avoiding the poor journey to understand the sound of Yuelu to know the strangeness of the wind and dust</h1>
    <p>The sixties of the sixtieth Xiangjiang River avoiding the poor journey to understand the sound of Yuelu to know the strangeness of the wind and dust  It is said that Zhao Xinyuan in the smoke mentioned earlier, since he has taken many teachers who have been cheating and poverty on Taojiazhuang, Nanchang, Jiangxi, they have lived on Taojiazhuang.</p>
<p>He was taught to him in his life.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want to look at Tao Jun in front of Zhuang a day.</p>
<p>I suddenly saw a silver dart flying in the woods on the forest in front of the slope, and then flew to a person in the distance.</p>
<p>Essence Only because the eight magic master Qiu Yan robbed a dart car on the Xichuan Road, was interfered by Zhao Xinyuan, looked at the victory, and flew a plum needle from the dark to defeat Yue Yan.</p>
<p>The person who looked for the needle was not held everywhere.</p>
<p>It was suspected that the heart source was the same as the party.</p>
<p>At that time, the heart source was excited for a moment of anger, and he did not recognize Qiu Yan.</p>
<p>Later, he had forged a grievance and knew that he was not an opponent.</p>
<p>He planned to go back to Yichang Sanyou Cave, and asked the Master and the monk Yifan to help each other.</p>
<p>The heart source had no choice but to take refuge and rushed to the rivers and lakes before living in the Tao family.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the people of the Eight Devils were clearly listened, and I came with the silver dart invitations.</p>
<p>The heart source knows that the disaster will come, knowing that it is not better than anyone, but avoiding the escape in the long run is not the law.</p>
<p>In the past, I can still push it without knowing it.</p>
<p>Now that I have come to the opposite side with the enemy, wouldn&rsquo;t it be sneered by the people in the world?</p>
<p>At the moment, I admit that I will go to Qingluo Mountain for the Dragon Boat Festival next year.</p>
<p>Then he said goodbye to Tao Jun, and planned to find a few helpers in this more than half a year.</p>
<p>After leaving Taojiazhuang, carefully calculated on the road, knowing that Master blame him, and he should not be able to go down the mountain without his studies.</p>
<p>In addition to Master Shi Yifan, all friends in their lives are just like the golden dragon, Wei Qing, and the Eight Demon Enemy.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I think of Master&rsquo;s two friends: one is Zhu Mei, who is the two old and middle -aged middle schools of Songshan, but the old man is in the same whereabouts, but you can encounter it.</p>
<p>Wang Feng lived in the Iron Taoist, he did not often go down the mountain all year round, and he was more confident to find him.</p>
<p>The above two people, but can find one, you can help him remove the magic, and you can also pull the Master Master Yifan to join the help.</p>
<p>After the idea was determined, Xiaoxing night stayed and went to Changsha.</p>
<p>At this time, just after the Manchu entered the customs, some of the traitors of the rebels lost both the festival.</p>
<p>How could there be a few who knew Tianliang and loved the people?</p>
<p>Coupled with some local tyrants and cunning officials who are tigers, the fox rats are based on the city, and they are good at being blessed.</p>
<p>All the sorrows of the people&rsquo;s suffering and unevenness are heard everywhere.</p>
<p>Essence I thought: &ldquo;I used to live in the middle of Sichuan because of the rare land and fertile land. Although I also encountered many stolen officials, it was not as powerful as Hunan Road. I reached out and hugged, and because the date was approaching. A fundamental solution is to save a family and two, not only to help, but even the owner and the end of goodness. It is better to be stolen by them for the time being. When they pass Duanyang, they are lucky enough to have a big deal with the majority of the colleagues. Instead, it is happy. At this time, I just pretend to be unknown, and let&rsquo;s talk about it. &quot;</p>
<p>If you have something in your heart, you naturally speed up. When I rushed to the top of Gu Wangfeng, I found it all over the mountains. Later, I walked at the foot of Yuelu Mountain and saw a Taoist. She dressed a somewhat strange look. That person also felt that the heart source was a capable person. The two sides were sitting in front of Yuemiao, and when they talked about each other&rsquo;s origin, they learned that the person was Huang Xuanji, and he also visited the Tiebi Taoist. He said that the source of his heart was unfortunate, and the Tiebi Taoist had gone to Yun Gui three days ago. The heart source was disappointed. Seeing that Huang Xuanji was very decent, and his ability was not weak, he told his heart and begged him to help him. Huang Xuanji said: &ldquo;Your Eight Devils are also enemies with me, just because of my lonely, but he can&rsquo;t. The two of me happened to be combined to find the ability to remove harm for the people. I have a little thing, For another day, you can go with you. &quot;</p>
<p>Although the heart source is anxious, it is not one day. Fortunately, he was alone and discussed with Huang Xuanji, and he turned around the apartment, wrapped his own small parcel, and moved to a small broken temple where Huang Xuanji lived. The time was late. Seeing that Huang Xuanji was talking about the same white middle -aged man, when he saw the arrival of his heart, he introduced it with both sides. When asked about the name of the man, he knew that he was the flying crane Zhou Chun in the clouds in the &ldquo;Qilu Sanying&rdquo;</p>
<p>in the past. Seeing that Zhou Chun was dressed in the usual family, he was a heroic style. Huang Xuanji and Zhou Chun had a strong talk. When he saw him coming in, after sitting, he no longer said. Guessing that there was a person who had a person, he got up and resigned. Huang Xuanji saw the meaning of Xinyuan, and then laughed: &ldquo;Actually, we said a few words, not avoided people, but when we didn&rsquo;t say it for the time being, Daoyou should not mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a few words of heart, he walked out of the temple alone to look at it. At this time, the sunset industry had no desire to go. Looking at the Xiangjiang River in the east, like a practice, it goes straight down. On the one hand, the peaks are inserted into the clouds, and the stars are all around. On the one hand is Pingchou Guangye, and the village house is dense. A ray of white cooking smoke revealed from the forest, rising. Due to the dying of the plants and trees, the more clearly appeared. The heart source was seeing the gods, and suddenly there was a footsteps behind him. Looking back, it turned out to be a poor old man who was wearing very dilapidated, with a greasy face, dragging two pieces of broken shoes, and kicking towards the heart source. You must not care about the poor appearance of the old man in others. At most, he is poor and poor, or Zhou Ji a few money. How keen at Xinyuan&rsquo;s vision is that before the old man has been closer, he has felt that he has a strange movement; and until the opposite side, he can&rsquo;t help but be surprised. Although the old man was poor, he was born with cranes and kite shoulders. He did not stuck in the dust, and his face was covered with greasy. The pair of semi -fitting eyes were shot and still could not hide that people&rsquo;s hidden. Gaoming. As soon as I moved my heart, I went forward to talk: &ldquo;Laozhang, do you see this night&rsquo;s scene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man heard the words and said angrily, &ldquo;Dog! Look at me so poor, and said that I have a good evening scene, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good, you are good. Do you dare to get rid of me for no reason? &quot;</p>
<p>Said, rubbing his palms, anger rushing, there was a lot of foundation. He Xinyuan knew that he was misunderstood. He was scolded for a few words and was not angry. He said backwards: &ldquo;Lao Zhangxiu is to be angry. I am talking about the evening scene of the sunset, not the evening scene of the old age. Laozhang was strange, please forgive Laozhang! &quot;</p>
<p>The old man heard the words, converged and anger, sighed, and walked around and walked away. Xinyuan quickly stepped forward and asked, &ldquo;What is the heart of Lao Zhang staying, so sighing? Why not say that it will come out, Xiao Cou is a little bit of effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man heard the words and ignored it. Essence  When Xinyuan saw the old man&rsquo;s step -by -step ages, the more he guess he was not an ordinary person, he chased after pulling his foot. The old man was sitting on the east of the east of Yuelu Mountain, and the old man was sitting on the rock, and he still sighed in his mouth. Xinyuan rushed to the old man and said a few words just now. The old man suddenly stood up, spit his face spit on his heart, and said, &ldquo;Do you want to help me be busy? You match it? You can&rsquo;t even take care of it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Xinyuan was insulted by the old man for no reason, Although I was angry in my heart, it was still not brought out of the face. When I heard the last sentence, there was a reason in the heavier. After drying his face, he replied with a smile: &ldquo;Xiao Ke knows that he has limited ability and can&rsquo;t help Laozhang, but listening to Laozhang&rsquo;s name, so that the late birthday to know Jing Mu, why is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man Hearing the words, haha ​​laughed: &ldquo;You have a good conservation, and you don&rsquo;t have the anger of my old man. What you say, I don&rsquo;t know a few words. You probably ask me why I sigh? You don&rsquo;t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, I have a good wife , Named Ling Xuehong, died a few years ago, and left my old man alone, alone. When she was there, she would jump the house and go to the family to steal some money to buy wine and drink. Jiu, even the rice is often not eaten. I have an apprentice named Zhou who tells me not to deceive others to eat. He is willing to provide me, and I don&rsquo;t want it; He invited me to eat the wine, how many thieves, the more I ate, the more uncomfortable it was. I ran under the underworld of Yuelu and wanted to meet two empties and lie to him for some wine. I didn&rsquo;t meet. Only there was an old way in the small broken temple, he was willing to invite me to eat. But I calculated that he asked me to finish drinking, and I would ask me to do something very difficult and troublesome, so I again I dare not appreciate it. How many times I thought about it after the temple in front of his temple, do n’t give people doing things, people wo n’t invite me to drink; I ’m lazy, in fact, I’ m so difficult than him a few years ago. I do n’t care; now I am old and lazy, I am going to eat in vain, and I ca n’t meet the empty. It ’s easy to meet you. What do you say in the evening? For a long time. I don&rsquo;t know what you are doing. Just see if you invite me to eat wine, you know you are empty. &quot;</p>
<p>Seeing the old man&rsquo;s speech was crazy, he knew that real people refused to show up.</p>
<p>In particular, he said that his wife was named Ling Xuehong, which was very familiar, and couldn&rsquo;t remember it for a while.</p>
<p>In my heart, I thought that the old man was not a first -class swordsman, but also a Taoist man.</p>
<p>Regardless of the purpose, no matter how he embarrassed himself, he decided to go with him a few times, and he would have to find out to hide it.</p>
<p>He smiled and replied: &ldquo;It turned out that Laozhang wanted to drink, and Xiao Ke was willing to ask. But did Lao Zhang accept his face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man said, &ldquo;Slowness and slow down. How many people have invited me to eat in these years, no one at first I regarded him as a while. Empty, after eating, I ate a soft mouth and gave them a busy one. I almost didn&rsquo;t get tired of me. I didn&rsquo;t know you with you. I asked me to eat alcohol when I met. Now this is this. Now this is this. How can there be a good person like you in the world? Can I treat you as an empty, and I will become empty when I finish eating? &quot;</p>
<p>He Xinyuan said:&rdquo; Lao Zhangxiu is going to worry, Xiao can be full of sincerity Ask. But Xiao Ke is still here. The place is not familiar. Please choose a good wine shop. How about Xiao Ke accompany Laozhang? &quot;</p>
<p>The old man said,&rdquo; So, are you willing to be empty? &quot;</p>
<p>Xin Yuan saw him was not polite, and said that he asked him to be empty, and he knew it intentionally, and he felt funny, but he still replied respectfully:&rdquo; Xiao can be devoted himself to ask, no other intention. Let&rsquo;s go. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man said,&rdquo; Go and go. I see if you come out of the small broken temple, you guess you are empty. You probably know the old way of the temple. When I went to make an appointment, I would like to be hungry, and I wouldn&rsquo;t go. &quot;</p>
<p>Xin Yuanben wanted to go with Huang and Tuesday. When he saw the old man said so, he had to give up. Fortunately, Huang Xuanji said that he would wait for a day. It&rsquo;s just that he had no time to meet with Zhou Chun. Nod nodding now.  The two went down the mountain and walked all the way to the west gate. On the road, Xinyuan asked the old man&rsquo;s name again. The old man said: &ldquo;The name was originally there a few years ago, and now I don&rsquo;t need it for a long time. You claim to be small, presumably your nickname, I will call you small. I haven&rsquo;t planned to pay back yet, I asked me to be upset, I listened to it. I would like it: I always love to wear white, but unfortunate Just call you Xiao Ke, no one has to ask the name anymore. If it is troublesome, I am different. &quot;</p>
<p>At this time, Xinyuan has seen the old man&rsquo;s history, so he has to respect it. After the two walked into the city, they found a famous restaurant on Ximen Street, called the wine insurance, and asked a lot of wine and vegetables. The old man saw that the wine was like a life -saving, grabbing, eating, drying his mouth, and drying in his hands. The heart source used a few words to test, and the old man didn&rsquo;t speak, only eating him. The heart source couldn&rsquo;t, and had to wait patiently to wait for him to finish eating. When he went back with him, he must know what happened. This meal of wine was eaten for two hours. It was not until the shop was about to come to the door. The wine guests walked all, and the old man said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wine was smoked and stood up. The bartender will come to the account, and the calculation is more than forty pounds. Slowly, the shop is said, and even the heart source is horrified. At the moment, the heart source met with the liquor, and accompanied the old man to go downstairs. As soon as I arrived on the street, the old man had to break up. The heart source asked where he lived and said he wanted to accompany him. The old man was furious: &ldquo;I know you are not at ease, obviously through this meal, I want to drunk me, send me to Hengshan, recognize the place where I live, and then steal me. You hate it. I eat it for nothing, wait for me to vomit you. &quot;</p>
<p>Then, I vomited. The heart source quickly avoided it, and he didn&rsquo;t pay attention to it, hitting a pedestrian. The man was a young son, but he was elegant and his eyebrows were hidden in his eyebrows. When the heart source accidentally hit someone, when he hurriedly lost his words, the person&rsquo;s knowledge was unintentional, and he did not care about it. When Xinyuan saw that the man was approaching in the dark, his face had a bitterness on his face, and he didn&rsquo;t care very much. When I was busy looking for the old man, the industry was far away, and the heart source quickly chased. The old man turned back to see the heart source coming, and ran away, and the foot of your heart source could not catch up. Cutly chased to the city wall. At this time, the city gate had been closed, and for a moment, the old man had stood on the city. How fast the heart source did not see how he went up. How can I see some behaviors? I couldn&rsquo;t hold the Di Yang in my mouth, so I asked the old man to stay. Under the feet, I was working hard to the city wall. The old man saw his heart chasing up, &ldquo;嗳&rdquo;</p>
<p>, a flipping bun, falling down the moat. Xinyuan hurriedly went down, looking for the old man, where there was a trace.  Although he knew that the old man was a strange man, he tried him deliberately, but he couldn&rsquo;t guess what it was. Seeing the stars in the sky, the cold wind is through the bones, and there are snow. After thinking about it for a while, I had no choice but to turn around and turn around Yuelu Mountain. The Huang Xuanji and Zhou Chun are no longer in the temple. Look at the paper under the lamp on the table, which says: Huang, Tuesday, because he did not see the turn, now there is something, you must go to Hengshan. Can come back. The tea and lights in the temple have been prepared. Please be sure to wait for them to come back and wait for the words together. When Xinyuan saw this note, he had to wait in the temple. Lying down on a table of the table, the trend of thoughts became up and down, and the sound of Quan Sheng Songtao&rsquo;s ears, which could not sleep. He got up again, walked out of the temple to see, and the four sides were dark. The heart source sat down on a big stone next to the temple. After a while, the tree was settled, and the snowflakes of the goose fluttered. In this silence, even the sound of the snowflakes can be heard. The more he was sitting, the more boring, and suddenly he felt that the forehead was cold and cold, and when he touched it with his hand, it turned out that Xue fell on his head and was flowed down by the heat.  Seeing that the snow was getting bigger and bigger, he stood up and trembled with snow, and he turned to the temple and heard a sound of breaking. Although the heart swordsmanship is not clever, he is an expert. He heard that people are powerful. They quickly hide their bodies in the tree, hiding in the dark, and watching a movement. Just hidden in shape, the person who drove the sword light had arrived in front of it, two yellow light flashed, and two strange people who appeared in front of the broken temple door, they were dressed like the Eight Demon Qiu Qi on the Xichuan Road in the past. Both of the hair are emitting, holding the long sword with a funeral door, and wearing a non -monk or not. Huang Guangying looked at it, and the shape was very vicious. The heart source was shocked, guessing that the eight devil followed to find a hatred. Self -thinking ability is by no means an opponent, and he dares not even move there. Between the thoughts, the two came to the temple, and they didn&rsquo;t even think about it. They had entered the temple. Heart source is secretly lucky to be in the temple. Just to escape while the two of them were disappeared. The emotion was in love with others, and there were more than two people who came. I couldn&rsquo;t help sighing, so I had to sit still. Not a lot of time, the two who had entered before have come out, and they shouted strangely, saying, &ldquo;Xu Yue said he lived here, how would he not be here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Busy, look at the lights in the temple, and it is expected that the cricket will not stay away. In the end, we are going back. We sat on the stone and waited for him to come back? &ldquo;Then he came to the big stone where the heart had just sat. At this time, the snow had stopped, and the snow on the ground was about about. The heart source saw clearly behind the tree, and when he saw the people walking next to him, he could not help but sweat secretly. Fortunately, the two had never seen the heart source, and only came to the tree, and then wipe out the snow on the stone with their hands, and sat down casually. Before sitting, I listened to one and said, &quot;</p>
<p>Sixth brother, you see that there are thick traces on the stone, and one person has sat here. : &ldquo;How difficult is this. We only let out the sword light and find it everywhere. Unless he is not here, he is still afraid that he will not appear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, I heard it.</p>
<p>The person who talked first jumped up and shouted, &ldquo;The sixth brothers are paying attention! Someone is secretly calculating me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, let&rsquo;s release the sword light and protect the body. The person who talked later asked. Then he said, &ldquo;I was listening to you, and suddenly someone beaten me in the darkness, and I hit my head. It was twice, and one person was hit again, and it was very heavy. Both of them were furious, and each of them released the sword light, stabbing up, down, left and right. Who knows that the faster the sword dances, the heavier the beating, and only the two people rose their heads, and the pain was unbearable. The heart source was shocked and scared after the tree. I suddenly saw that the two were beaten by a person who had a darkest place. It was very funny. I almost forgot that they could not move. I heard one of the two of them said, &quot;</p>
<p>Sixth brother, I think the matter tonight is a bit strange. At first, find that nagging, but it was good. Why did you sit on the stone and get up? To say that it is you and the enemy. With that person who can be invisible, he can take my life like a counterattack. Probably we hit the tree god. One said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like this, don&rsquo;t know the true and false, and pay attention to jokes. The man is neither in the temple, so we will go back for the time being, come again tomorrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s twice. The two demon kings were scared and did not speak. When the heart source saw the two fled timidly, his expression was very embarrassed, and he felt funny. Suddenly, when Huang Guang turned straight in the air, it seemed to have something to block, forcing the two yellow light to be like a frozen fly drilling window paper, and it was impulsive on all sides, but he couldn&rsquo;t fly out of the circle. The heart source was secretly surprised. After a while, the two yellow light fell at the same time, and the previous two still appeared. When they walked in front of the big tree hidden in the heart, they talked about it for a while. I thought of words, and I didn&rsquo;t see the movement for a while. Just listen to one humanity: &ldquo;Strange! Weird! Why don&rsquo;t you even have our spells tonight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another person replied: &ldquo;I see that there will be such a big ability here, I can not show up, Breaking my magic method, and the one waiting for me, it is definitely embarrassed by that tree god and me. &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this, the voice lowered. After a while, the two approached the big tree and said to the tree, &ldquo;I have come here to find an enemy, and I have never embarrassed with God. People stood in front of themselves, and they couldn&rsquo;t be separated from Zhang Xu, so scared that they didn&rsquo;t dare to come out. Listening to the two of him, he wished him, and even his suspicion was to collide with the gods of Benshan, so he couldn&rsquo;t move. When I was thinking, I suddenly sneered at &quot;</p>
<p>噗&rdquo; behind my head, which shocked my heart.</p>
