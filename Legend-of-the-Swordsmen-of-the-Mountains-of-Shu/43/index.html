    <p>Forty -two -back the guesthouse against the lone lamp, the fairy edge of the white eyebrows, leaving a brief frozen clouds and the Shushu Ridge, a few intestines, filial piety, crying, crying and decaying  Talking about Ying Qiong&rsquo;s nature, he walked towards the window and looked out with the window.</p>
<p>This room is not far from the shop, and it is very clear.</p>
<p>At this time, a bowl of pink steamed meat came in at the small ends of the shop.</p>
<p>Li Ning was about to call Yingqiong to sit down and eat it while it was hot.</p>
<p>Suddenly listening to Ying Qiong said: &ldquo;Daddy came to see, isn&rsquo;t this a monk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Li Ning also looked at the window, he saw a bunch of people outside and holding a monk. Essence I couldn&rsquo;t help but move, and I was about to ask the shop who came in. This life is fast. If you do n’t ask Li Ning as a question, you will take the lead: &ldquo;Come and use meals, so as not to be cold, the weather is cold, it is not easy to use. Living. It is also a good business today, and rushing in October incense floods. Only this room left in the whole store has not been leased and allowed to live to the guest officer. . But he didn&rsquo;t go to hang up the order, but he had to run to us to force the shop. How can the Lord come to the door? We are willing to live in the account room evenly. The official room. Ask him what the truth is? He said that the Feng Shui of this room is too good, whoever lives and who will become a immortal. If you don&rsquo;t let it, he will set fire to the house. Every year, the people in Chaoshan are full of thousands of people. They eat by Lafayette to eat, and they dare not offend the disciples of Buddhism. If in Beizhou County, they are unreasonable like him, let the place catch it, and send it to the gate. The board was expelled from the mile. &quot;</p>
<p>The Xia Erlianzhu said that he said this big set, and Li Ning only cared for. I couldn&rsquo;t help but annoyed Yingqiong and said, &ldquo;Daddy, this monk is too unreasonable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words weren&rsquo;t, and suddenly listened to the monk outside and said loudly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, you don’t know? Talking. It is reasonable, and I will leave the room again. &quot;</p>
<p>When Li Ning heard this, he couldn&rsquo;t bear it anymore. He couldn&rsquo;t care about eating anymore. He hurriedly got up and went out of the room. Then he said: &ldquo;This shop is full of customer. If the old Zen master is not abandoned, he invite to sit in the middle and medium to sit in my room. On the one hand, the store and the old Zen master can do it. At that time, I moved in the cabinet room and how did I live in my concession and the old Zen master? &quot;</p>
<p>The white eyebrow monk said:&rdquo; You are a knowledge. If you want to affect the poor monks, you will be troubled by many in the future. Wouldn&rsquo;t I get on your fingers? I still don&rsquo;t want it. &quot;</p>
<p>At this time, the people who watched saw Li Ning come out to interpret with the store. The monk was still unreasonable. That monk is not something, how can the monks be unreasonable? Everyone thinks that Li Ning heard that it is necessary to have a monk. Speaking of the later, the monk laughed and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think that I am not as reasonable. I go out when I go out. How can there be many silver two? You let the room with me, wouldn&rsquo;t I get a few more money? I want to live, I intend to discuss with you: if you live in the cabinet room, you can get the money in the house; The money in the cabinet. The shop is only eight minutes of silver for a day. Regardless of eating, we only hold it. We all explain that this is a fair transaction, and I am willing to do it like this, otherwise you will go to you. You have nothing to do. Can you see it? &quot;</p>
<p>Li Ning said:&rdquo; Where does the old Zen master say? You and I have a fate, what are the money? What do you have to make a shop? Pay, slightly desperate. How about honor? &quot;</p>
<p>The monk heard the words of joy:&rdquo; So good. &quot;</p>
<p>He said to the shopkeeper:&rdquo; Everyone everyone heard, but the money of the house was given by him. Didn&rsquo;t I ask him? I said it long ago, if I want that room, who dare not let me? You see this sentence without saying nothing? &quot;</p>
<p>One is to respectfully recognize the loss and be ridiculed; the other is to eat white and drink, and it should be said cheap. The store wanted to tell Li Ning a few words, and she couldn&rsquo;t help making her eyes. Li Ning pretended not to understand. Because the shop was willing to care about the two sides, he had to ask Ming Li Ning to talk about the money of the house and the money. The monk no longer cared about it, and went straight in. After arriving in the room, he kept drinking with wine.  It is said that the cabinet room was originally a small sleeve room. The shop was used to pile up debris. It was dirty and dark, and the light and air were abnormal. At first the shop was originally a monk, who wants to go to the house. After moving in, the store was so good that he couldn&rsquo;t go into the room. Li Ning was so safe, and he didn&rsquo;t take care of it at all. Seeing that the store entered the room to comfort, only the person who said it was the same, there was nothing. The small two who served the house in the room, seeing that the monk was vegetarian, all made a large table, as if relying on someone to account, he didn&rsquo;t feel bad at all. He scolded him to eat and eat, and he was unconvinced for Li Ning. I was afraid that the monk would eat too much. Li Ning was unwilling. He took the time to Li Ning&rsquo;s house to report: &ldquo;This monk is simply unreasonable. Here, don&rsquo;t let people think of themselves as empty. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Ning secretly smiled the small two eyes, because he was kind to see him, he couldn&rsquo;t bear to refute him. Just say that he is still willing to facing the mountain, and vowed not to compare with the disciples of Buddhism. No matter how much money he eats, it has nothing to do. And instructed the shop to serve well. If the master who went to the room was not blaming him, he would pay more money with him. Although the shop was dissatisfied in his heart, he saw Li Ning&rsquo;s insistence, and he was helpless. He went to the room to serve. When Yingqiong saw her father, she knew that she would do something. Although she was young, she was not an ordinary woman. She did not lose money on her heart, but she was curious. She asked the origin of the monk several times and was stopped by Li Ning. After this time, the sky was dark. Li Ningshi was stirred by the monk. He only ate half full. He called some diet at the moment and dinner with Ying Qiong again to make up for the second half of this meal. After eating and drinking, the karma has passed. The store also withdrew to the city&rsquo;s recruitment and went to the store. The guests who lived in the shop, sleeping peacefully, returned to the room. Not mentioned.  Li Ning dazed at a vegetable lamp on the table for a while. When Ying Qiong had to ask again, Li Ning stood up and asked Ying Qiong to not go out casually. When he was sleepy, he might as well sleep at himself. Ying Qiong asked if he went to the upper room to visit the great monk. Li Ning nodded and told Yingqiong to wait for the back to the mountain, don&rsquo;t ask more. After all, I opened the door gently and saw the lights of each house dim. I knew that these Chaoshan guests had been going to bed early, and I was going to get up early to burn the incense. Then put the pace, walked to the upper room window, and looked at it from the window seam. The oil lamp in the car was very strong, and a note was pressed under the lamp. Looking for the monk again, Li Ning was surprised. At first glance, the door of the door was buckled, gently pushed the window, flew in, picked up the note under the lamp table, and saw the words &ldquo;Ningbi Cliff&rdquo;</p>
<p>written on it. The ink was still new. For a long time. Put down the note, hurried out, and jumped on the roof to see. The dog barking in the deep alley was dismantled, and zero fell on the ground. Seeing the head of Shenlong, Hong Fei is already underworld. Where can I find a trace of signs? Knowing that the monk has gone far, the stranger has lost his arms, and he is so regretful. I didn&rsquo;t ask his name and address before, but helplessly, I had to turn over to the ground and think about it carefully: &ldquo;Is that Ningbi Cliff? When staying in the room, when you hurried into the room to see, the scenery in the room did not move, but the note did not know where to go. I found it in the room and did not find it. There is no wind, and it is impossible to be blown out of the window by the wind. It can be seen that the monk has not gone far, or he is in charge of whether he has sincerity. I used to observe well before. This person must be here for myself, leaving a place specially to allow myself to track and find it.
It is still inconvenient to surprise the store and still come out of the window.</p>
<p>When she returned to the room to watch Yingqiong, she saw her under the table, and her eyes looked at a note in her hand.</p>
<p>Seeing Li Ning coming in, he got up and asked, &ldquo;Do Daddy see the white eyebrow monk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Ning couldn&rsquo;t say that when he had to see the note, it was left by the monk of talents. Essence Ying Qiong: &ldquo;Where do you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong said: &ldquo;The talented father came out. After a while, I was thinking that the monk&rsquo;s whereabouts were strange here, and suddenly the lights were shaking, and I left this note in front of me. . When I ran under the window to see, I was seeing my father down from the room and jumped into the window of the room. What does the three words &quot;</p>
<p>Ningbi Cliff&rdquo; mean? How can I fly into the room out of thin air? Li Ning said: &quot;</p>
<p>Probably I have recently converted to the Three Treasures and moved the experts of the masters to come to give pointers. This&rdquo; Ningbi Cliff &quot;</p>
<p>thinks that the high -man fairy Buddha calls me to go. Qi Zi, get rid of the world. It&rsquo;s just you &hellip; &ldquo;Speaking of which, his eyes are sad and sad. Ying Qiong asked: &quot;</p>
<p>Good father, natural daughter. What about her daughter?&rdquo; Li Ning said: &quot;</p>
<p>I have not made up my mind at this time. Yeah. &ldquo;Ying Qiong couldn&rsquo;t bear it anymore at this time, forcing him to ask for details. Li Ning said: &quot;</p>
<p>For the father, the father has recently seen breaking the world, just for Xiang Ping&rsquo;s wish, and he can&rsquo;t get into the mountains. When you meet the monk on the streets of Shi Caicai, I listen to his voices of the Buddha to shake my eardrum. This is the inner family. A kind of qi, do nothing for me for no reason. It is by no means a cause, not a fairy Buddha, but also a swordsman, and then I met each other. Later, I thought of you, I am afraid that I couldn&rsquo;t help it. At first I thought it was accidental. When he heard the room he had instructed me to live, he said many unreasonable words, so he knew that it was even more reasonable. The obscure came from the door. The prudential result, so let him enter the room first, and then check to see the movement. When I went, I saw that there was this note on the table. People had gone far before they realized that the monk was really coming for me. It ’s just the vast seas and there are many famous mountains. Where can I find me to find this Ningbi Cliff? Even after looking for it, I must not take you, how can I arrange it? Lost? So I plan to go back to the mountain and think about it for a few days. &ldquo;Ying Qiong heard:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daddy&rsquo;s words are bad! Although my daughter is young, I have recently studied internal and external merits. After the deep ditch, the birds could not fly, and the people were stunned. As long as the father had to leave three or five years of daily fees, the daughter only bought the mountains twice a year, purchased application items, and worked hard as much as possible. No one came to disturb. Three or five years later, her daughter practiced martial arts, and then went to visit her father&rsquo;s whereabouts. The father introduced a female teacher with ability and swordsmanship, and then learned to become swordsmanship to save the world. Isn&rsquo;t it wonderful? Life is at least a century, and Dad has learned to become avenue. At least for at least a thousand years? Daughter can also follow the light. Wouldn&rsquo;t it be like the short -term gathers at present? ? &quot;  When Li Ning saw the young girl in front of this knee, she had this ambition, and talked about it. She never took the pain of separation from the pain of her heart. Then he said to her: &quot;</p>
<p>How can there be such a wishful abacus? You want to live in that despair for three or five years, how easy it is to talk about. It is not too early, and you will return to the mountain tomorrow. Let ’s. The world’ s famous mountains are more than a thousand. I do n’t know which mountains are in the mountains, far away. &ldquo;Ying Qiong said:&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think the monk is willing to come to point out, there is no near the world, not near the world. The human fairy Buddha, he not only intended for his father and his daughter, I am afraid that the place name he stayed, and it was by no means a thousand miles away. &quot; Compassion came to my father, you can simply even me together. Places where you live, please say it out, don&rsquo;t call us embarrassment, be stuffy gourd. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Ning saw Yingqiong a childishness, funny, and distressed again. Essence I no longer talk to her, I just urged her to sleep.  At the moment Li Ning went to the toilet first, Ying Qiong was convenient in the room, and came back to sleep on the two shops that were paved. Ying Qiong still studied what method to use to find Ningbianbian. Li Ning was full of mind, and the bedding borrowed in the store was not clean.  Time is easy, and the cold chicken will be reported for a while, and the outsiders are noisy. Li Ning also wanted to ask Ying Qiong to sleep for a while, but fortunately it was okay to return to the mountain. Ying Qiong is anxious, she is dirty, insisted on. Li Ning had to open the door to call the store to wash the water. At this time, the sky was bright. Today is the first day of Xiangyun. The incense customers in the store get up before Tianwei to enter the mountain to grab the burning fragrance. People have gone most of them. Those who haven&rsquo;t left are also hiring the sedan, it seems very lively in the store. The shop Xiao Er heard Li Ning&rsquo;s call and came in. Li Ningming knew that the monk had gone, and the store must come to report, and deliberately pretended to be unknown. Whoever thinks that the shop Xiao Er does not speak, but only helps Li Ning clean up things that bring them into the mountains. Later, Li Ning couldn&rsquo;t help asking: &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know that today it was Xiangyun. I wanted to live more days. Now I just plan to go to see the fun. You go to the account of my account in the house. Hire two pick -ups for me and pick these things from friends in the mountains into the mountains. Go back and make more wine money with you. &quot;</p>
<p>The shop Xiao Er heard and laughed:&rdquo; The guest officer really has eyesight. People. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Ning heard, and asked,&rdquo; What do you say? &quot;</p>
<p>The shop Xiao Er said:&rdquo; Yesterday, the master said like that, so he told us to look angry. I met a good person like a guest officer. At first, he called vegetables and wines, and he didn&rsquo;t use it much. He obviously used the guest officer to be empty and practiced people. We were not convinced, and we were afraid that he would have a lot of trouble in the future. Whoever thought he was a good person, but he loved joking. &quot;</p>
<p>Li Ning was anxious to know the monk&rsquo;s movement. When he saw that the shop was not right, he asked, &ldquo;Is the master who came back again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Master did not go back for a while, and did not return. However, when he left, he had paid him with the account of the guest officer together and appreciated me for five or two silver wine. He said that the guest officer lived in Emei. He is a neighborhood neighbor. Although he is a good Buddha, he goes to watch other temples and worships. He didn&rsquo;t make fun of it. When he was happy, his anger was also flat. I asked him the name of the residence and the temple on the mountain. He said that the guest officer knew that he was close at hand, and he was looking for. Faith, ask me to wait for the guest officer to get up, and then take it out for you. &ldquo;When Li Ning busy opened the letter to see, I saw it read:&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you want to leave first, you can leave. Sorrowful beads, first seek liberation. The bright moon plum blossoms, the gods fall. Survage the dragon, the unique group of demons. It can be seen that the monk did not leave him last night, and he was listened to him. Now that he is willing to let go of the letter, he must have a good heart for Ying Qiong. After watching the father and daughter, they couldn&rsquo;t help looking at their eyes. The shop asked: &ldquo;In the letter, the guest officer went to his temple to burn incense? I think he was a monk, and he was willing to pay the account on behalf of the guest officer. Then use words to support me.  After a while, the shop was hired to pick a husband, and Li Ning&rsquo;s father and daughter packed up. After understanding the bridge, walking into the avenue of the mountain. Two peaks on the face, dog teeth are staggered, and the situation is very majestic. Along the way, I saw that the good men and women in Chaoshan were endless. The temple on the mountain is more than 100, only the sound of the bells of the foothills in the foothills of the mountains, and the Buddha&rsquo;s name of the mountain is sounded, lined with the great solemnity of this famous mountain, which makes people respect naturally. Because Li Ning did not enter the temple to burn incense, he was inconvenient to pick a lot of things from the crowd. When you arrived at the body, put everything down and develop your foot. When the choice of husband walked away, according to the previous method, the father and daughter carried the applications bought by the father and daughter one by one. Back to the stone cave, due to the short winter days, it has gradually become darker. The father and daughter entered the hole to lift the oil lamp and place the object. After a day of tiredness, I felt a little bit of hard work.
From the morning of the second day, first discuss the overall winter plan.</p>
<p>When all the things were arranged, they took out the two notes of the monk, and the same thing was carefully described in the same shop.</p>
<p>Li Ning said to Ying Qiong: &ldquo;This monk said that he was a neighbor with me, and Ningbi Cliff was not far from here. I would like to take advantage of the weather in the past few days. Can&rsquo;t come back on the same day, you must not worry, don&rsquo;t leave here. &quot;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong nodded. From this day, Li Ningguo has been searching several times behind this mountain. Go to many famous temples in Benshan and ask someone to know where this Ningbi Cliff is, and no one knows. Ying Qiong was idle. Except for daily hard work, he took the many hidden weapons he used by his old father that year, and went to the mountains to follow. Sometimes it ’s a lot of odors, and it is salted with salt and prepared for winter. She was born and clever, and was born with great power. No matter what martial arts, they would be fine for a while. Since entering the mountains to the present, although it only takes a few months, I have learned a lot of ability. Her light -body technique was even more practiced than ape, and she was like a bird. Daily jumping through the mountains, the bigger and bigger, and the farther walking. In addition to the three or five on the 35th, Li Ning went to the cliff to learn the spring water, and he was only listening to the whereabouts of the monk, and had no time to examine his daughter&rsquo;s homework. Ying Qiong was afraid his father was worried, and he came to restrain herself, and did not say to her father. The father and daughter are all early and late every day, and are accustomed to it.  After more than a month, the whereabouts of Ning Biya still did not inquire. At this time, the dragon was approaching, and the weather was cold. The cave they lived in was originally where the mountains were the most windy, and the winter was warm in summer. With Li Ningbu, they made a flame in the cave. On this day, Li Ning did a little cold in the depths of the Houshan in the depths of the mountain, and his body was slightly uncomfortable. Ying Qiong persuaded him to stop getting up, raised his rest for a few days, and then went to find the whereabouts of Ningbi Cliff. While getting up and got out of bed, he took some storage branches, burned porridge, and rushed to the wind with her father, and sweated. When I got up, I felt chills although I was wearing heavy cotton. When I saw it, I saw the snowflakes flying, and I couldn&rsquo;t help it from the next. There were many Qiong Palace Van Yu in the surrounding peaks and half of the mountains around the Qiong Yao world. Below the mountains, it is a vast, turning into a snow sea. The snowflakes are like cotton, flying in the air, and they can&rsquo;t distinguish the snow flying up or falling. Ying Qiong has seen such a wonderful scene and jumped up with joy. In a hurry to enter the cave report, &ldquo;Daddy, the snow was snowing outside, and the scenery was very beautiful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Ning heard the words, sighed, &ldquo;Ningbi Cliff has no news, heavy snow seal the mountain, I don&rsquo;t want my fate to be shallow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong Tao: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter of this? The fairy can&rsquo;t help but make sense, and it is not that we do not go to visit it. It is that he deliberately uses that kind of problem to make it difficult. The same? Dad, this age, according to the daughter&rsquo;s opinion, simply passed the cold winter. Let&rsquo;s talk about the beauty of the same spring in the spring? &quot;</p>
<p>Li Ning couldn&rsquo;t bear to wipe out the intention of his daughter, and he nodded in the illness. Yingqiong ran to the back of the cave stone room to cook porridge, and cooked a piece of bacon that was cooked in the wild vegetables dug in the mountain yesterday, cutting a plate of cooked odor. There were no furniture in the cave, so he rolled a large piece of daily meals to Li Ning stone couch. Then he brought firewood in the flames before he went to Li Ning for meals. I saw Li Ning still fell asleep in his face, moaning slightly. Ying Qiong was shocked. When he was busy using his hand to touch his head, he felt that Li Ning Zhou was hot and hot. It turned out that the cold and heat were worsened, and the disease was not light. A young girl with a half -year -old father left her hometown for a long time and came to this deep mountain. Suddenly her father was sick, how could it not be burned in five! Ying Qiong&rsquo;s eyes in the two lines of tears in his eyes, and gently called by Li Ning&rsquo;s ears: &ldquo;Daddy, where is it bad? Daughter has cooked the porridge, please sit up, drink some hot porridge, sweat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sleeping, I couldn&rsquo;t help spit out a slight sound in my mouth, and vaguely heard the words &ldquo;Ningbi Cliff&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Ying Qiongzhi is a heart disease, and with the wind of the sun, the cold and heat are mixed, and the sorrowful language is made. I encountered heavy snow again, and went down the mountain to the mountains. I was young, the road was unfamiliar, and there was nowhere to extend the medical treatment. Li Ning has no second person support. I can&rsquo;t help but be sad and scared again. When he was afraid of the extreme, he couldn&rsquo;t stop shouting &ldquo;Daddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Ning was unconscious and was so anxious that Ying Qiong was burning in five, and the rice had no intention to eat. Quickly ordered a fragrant candle, kneeling in front of the cave, and prayed on the blessing. The more you think about, the more sad, you hid outside the cave to cry. This kind of miserable situation is really Axia Yin ape, there is no such thing. Just crying with the trees, only one azalea, helping her crying on the branches.  At this time, the snow was still more and more prosperous. The entrance of their caves, at the highest point of the mountain, although the snow is thin, but outside of ten feet, it is no clear to east, south and south. Ying Qiong&rsquo;s four cares, without a care, crying and hissing, suddenly stopped crying. Thinking for a while, crying again; crying for a while, went in to call his father again; I couldn&rsquo;t wake up, and I cried again. It seemed to be crying like this, I don&rsquo;t know if there were several times. The last time I cried into the cave, I heard Li Ning calling her nickname, happy in her heart, and in front of the couch, busy: &ldquo;Daddy, daughter here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Who wants Li Ning to wake up, The original talent did not call her, it was her spiritual effect. In this case, the more sad it was, and he no longer looked at Li Ning&rsquo;s crying, holding Li Ning&rsquo;s head, crying, and shouting. After shouting for a while, I heard Li Ning said, &ldquo;Ying&rsquo;er, what are you crying? I was just a bit cold, my heart was sad, I couldn&rsquo;t move, and it would be good in a while. You should not be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong sees Li Ning to speak, and in my heart Da happy, hurriedly stopped the crying, and asked Dad to eat porridge. Li Ning nodded. When Ying Qiong watched the porridge, because of the rush, the fire was destroyed, and the porridge was cold. She was so anxious that she was so busy. Looking at the porridge pot, he was afraid that Li Ningzhong fell asleep again, so he went to see it. The fire is small, and it is not easy to cook for a while, and it is so indifferent. It&rsquo;s easy to look forward to the porridge heat. Because Li Ning was sick, he didn&rsquo;t dare to call him to eat it. He quickly took some pickles and sent it to the couch with the porridge. Give up Li Ning, touch his head, still get hot. After using the pillow, he was padded with his back, holding the porridge bowl by himself, picked the pickles with one hand, and fed it with his father with a bite of porridge. Li Ning has a person&rsquo;s meal, and Ying Qiongba can not add this bowl after eating this bowl. Who wants Li Ning to eat most of the bowl and shake his head and fall again.</p>
