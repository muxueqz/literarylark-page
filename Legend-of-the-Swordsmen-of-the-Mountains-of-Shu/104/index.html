    <p>The 1st 33rd long smiles fall into the poultry evil ridge for no reason to return to the hometown of the United States and the family.</p>
<p>Yuan Xing climbed up from the wolf under the cliff, walked to the crowd, and bowed and enjoyed: &ldquo;Wu Xiangu was going to go back to the sword, and he said that Yuan Xing and Gang Yu guarded the back hole. The monk of the thief was falling from a cat -in in the air. Yuan Xing was hit by the coming to the cliff. He did not hear the origin of the people. He first suffered a bit of suffering in the back hole. Ranged out. &quot;</p>
<p>Jin Chan saw that it had no words, and was about to blame. After hearing a sound, Yuan Xing slapped early on his left cheek, and he touched his face with a hairy hand and jumped. Jin Chan laughed: &ldquo;Good fight! Who told you to hurt people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong saw it disadvantaged and could not bear it, and he couldn&rsquo;t bear it. While drinking Yuan Xing, he said nothing and said well. Jin Chan shouted, &ldquo;Brother Xiao appeared, I think you are going to die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lian shouted several times, and did not agree.  When Yuan Xing saw Jin Chan&rsquo;s name, he realized that the person was actually a family, and he had been suffering from many injustices. The crowd was asking questions again, and had to bear to answer: &ldquo;Yuan Xing saw the monk dropped from the air falling from the air, thinking who thought he had hit him from the air, and was afraid that he would be injured and called Gang Yu to pick it up. I am afraid that it will be a spy, and wait for him to come down. Yuan Xingsu is convinced of steel feathers, but forgets the corner with it a while ago. Fighting. Sure enough, the monk was teasing people. Seeing that he was about to land on the ground, somehow, there was no shadow. Looking back, he was running into the cave, and he said in his mouth, &quot;</p>
<p>Emei is fundamentally fundamental Heavy ground, after seeing that a group of men and women had to invade a lot, but using such a useless bald tail Monkey Monkey to keep the door, it was a joke. &ldquo;Because he did not report and did not say the history, he walked inside without anyone, and his mouth was unveiled. Yuan Xing&rsquo;s shortcomings, I forgot that Gang Yu also stood on a rock in front of the cave, but did not stop it, but for a while, I caught up. He stopped and asked where he came from. He didn&rsquo;t say a word. He stood up carefully from head to toe first, and then said, &quot;</p>
<p>I see, although you have been a beast under the orthodox door, but there is another one more. The face is so angry that there must be a few more clever people to discipline. &ldquo;The disciples asked his origin again. He exited the cave and said,&rdquo;</p>
<p>You ask me the origin, and someone must ask you to be a housekeeping dog here. You have the ability to look at home, and the enemies who come will be dealt with. If the enemy can&rsquo;t live, you want to ask the origin of the family, which is also Bai Rao. Besides, the history is not too late. &ldquo;Yuan Xingyuan hated him and scolded him, and he was afraid to offend his owner&rsquo;s friend. He couldn&rsquo;t make a hand with him and asked him how to fight. He said that he used empty hands to call Yuan Xing to cut him with a sword. . Yuan Xing thought that there was such a cheap thing, first afraid of killing people, or using hands. It was he urged, and Yuan Xing ate him a few more times. Although others were small, the slap was harder than iron. Fortunately, he forced Yuan Xing to use a sword. Who knows that it is okay not to use a sword. When he used the sword, he was so anxious that he would dance the sword light. He was beaten by scolding and fell more than a dozen pounds, and his whole body hurt. He even said that I was useless waste, and he would not fight with me. Say, go inside. As soon as the monk left, he urged his disciples to chase quickly. He chased here and saw that the owner Xiangu didn&rsquo;t know him, so he wanted to take the opportunity to start behind him. I only felt that he turned around, and the two swords on his hand seemed to be blocked by something. Then he was beaten by him, kicked his kick, and fell to the cliff. &quot;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong heard that he felt that his fault was not in Yuan Xing, and the coming people beating people secretly was a little displeased. At this time, anyone who met with the people, and Judong asked Brother Xiao to come from his background and meet everyone. Jin Chan was shouting, and someone stuffed with someone in his hand. When Jin Chan was first met with the people in Chengdu, he was often made with invisible method, and he had already paid attention to this. I couldn&rsquo;t care about picking up things, and I took advantage of it. I was happy in my heart, and I was about to speak. Suddenly someone in my ear said, &ldquo;You let go first, I will come to you, I will never go. It&rsquo;s just that there are too many women in the same door here. When I came, I saw the monkey&rsquo;s madness again. Pride, the battle is stubborn, and deliberately frustrated its anger. I don&rsquo;t want to be guilty of no experience, so I don&rsquo;t want to show up. I also have a lot of things to do with my division. How do you go to me to talk to me? &quot;</p>
<p>Jin Chan knows him Temperament, he had to follow him. Looking at the things in your hand, it was two Zhu Guo. If there is no time to ask the origin, he said to everyone, &ldquo;Brother Xiao is unwilling to see the same door, you just practice. I will go with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, go alone to the embroidery clouds alone. At a glance, Yingqiong saw Jin Chan holding two Zhu Guo in his hand. He guessed that he was a Mang Cangshan thing. He couldn&rsquo;t help thinking of Ruolan. When he moved, he was about to ask, and when he was about to ask, Jin Chanye had run away like flying. Lingyun couldn&rsquo;t hold the cave because of spells, I am afraid that there were treasures in it and made mistakes. Not mentioned.  Jin Chan passed the embroidery clouds, and the monk laughed was born, holding a small sword and a letter with a cold -eyed shot in his hand. Seeing each other again and talking about some experiences.  It turned out that after the incident of Ciyun Temple, the disciples went to various places to accumulate foreign achievements. Because the monk laughed with Jin Chan, he requested that he went all the way to the Black Children&rsquo;s Captain Chihuo and marched to the province of Yunnan in order to meet Jin Chan, who went to Fuxiantan, Guihua Mountain. I did n’t know that Jin Chan and other places encountered Mrs. Xian and Miao Yiyi halfway. They did n’t return to Jiuhua, and went to Emei to open up the Ningbi Cliff Xianfu. Later, when you calculated the journey of Jin Chan, he should be discussed with Wei Chihuo to discuss with Wei Chihuo. Relying on the invisible swordsmanship, he was not afraid of the red flowers to see through. For example, the safflower is reasonable and promised to give it to the grass, otherwise it can help Jin Chan and wait for the power.  The two rushed to Fuxiantan to see that Naitan had become a calamity of the sea of ​​fire. Many mountains and stones were burned into scorched earth. Guess is that Jin Chan and other industries have returned to the mountains. I don&rsquo;t know if they have achieved it. They have to meet in Jiuhua after a while. The two of him decided to go deep into the people and accumulate good deeds. He and Wei Chihuo&rsquo;s life are different: one is a big head round face, Yan Ruwen Yu, seeing people laughing first, seemingly funny, with a group of anger. One is that from head to toe, the body is as dark as iron, and the sound is like a Hong Zhong. They are all young. They seem to be 14 or five years old. The costumes are a monk. They are unhappy and accompanied. The people they meet think they are the young monks and travelers who have escaped in the temple. The monk laughed when he saw that he was strange to see him, and he became more and more crazy. Smile monk&rsquo;s heart is the most kind. However, the black child Wei Chihuo was rigid and jealous, and was jealous. Regardless of the murderer, wicked people, or local tyrants met him, nine nine could not escape his life. The Monk of Xiaoxiao felt that he could not give people a new way, fearing to create evil causes, and persuaded him to repeatedly change.  On this day, I walked to the mountains near Kunming. Seeing that the sunset was already in the twilight scene, when the twilight was in March, the mountains were purple, and the willow leaves were golden. The scenery was very gorgeous. Wei Chihuo said to the monk with a smile: &ldquo;Smile brothers, often heard that you laughed, not only the sound of the forestry, the hundred birds were shocked, but also shocked the leopard and deterred the ape. If you are used to vegetarian food, you will have the method of puppets. If you eat or not, you will not be tightened. Although I am in Xuanmen, Master has never banned me. There is only Wuqi Yinzi given by Master in the waist. In the past few days, some fast rice is rare. I want to fight tiger and leopard in the mountains. It can be eaten by barbecue. There will be a beast hidden in unmanned. Why don&rsquo;t you laugh the last time and shock some beasts such as tiger and leopard. Please use it? &quot;</p>
<p>Although the monk&rsquo;s skills were high, but he took off his mother&rsquo;s fetal, and he was treated by ascetic head tuto. Because he was born with a Buddhist root, he was loved. The bitterness of the ascetic Tuo Tuo was the strictest. The monk of the Monk of Laughing held the clear rules and had a subtlety of fifteen or six years. For the first time, when you have accumulated foreign achievements, although there is also an unavoidable huntering, you can still play with it. Then he replied: &ldquo;Although the tiger and leopard are eating Menglu, it lurks in the mountains and does not see its evil miracles. . &quot;</p>
<p>Wei Chihuo said:&rdquo; You are really nerd! How can there be a tiger and leopard in the world? It is not removed now. Wait until the person has been killed, and then remove it. We greeted them. If it sees that we don&rsquo;t want to violate, it can be seen that it is a good tiger, we won&rsquo;t kill it. What do you think? &quot;</p>
<p>The monk laughed was forced to him, but he had to agree.</p>
<p>The two first sought a shelter, moved a few big stones, supported wild stoves, and then went to height.</p>
<p>I looked around, and it was everywhere, the jungle was dense, the cliffs, and the beautiful beast cave house.</p>
<p>Looking back, in a deep valley in the northeast of the mountain, the mist was deep, and the valley was taken by the oblique sun, and there was a dark red atmosphere.</p>
<p>As soon as the monk&rsquo;s heart moved, he thought, &ldquo;At this time, the weather was clear, although it was the peak risk and the Lin Jing was dense, but there were many Jiamu Gaulin here, and the miscellaneous flowers were blooming. How to do the sun is such a dark and dark color? With your own eyes, you will not see it. Since entering Yunnan, many poisonous and evil have been encountered along the way, and it is not the same as what you see today. That place is by no means good. &quot;</p>
<p>Thinking of this, the black child urged. Smile and laughed: &ldquo;Brother Hei, listen carefully, don&rsquo;t want to stimulate your ears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he swayed his head, stretched his neck and breathed, and even opened the breath of Dantian. The sound is like Shengquan, which is very pleasant. However, when he sounded for a moment, he listened to the woods on the side, and there was a commotion. The night crow in the sky, when he smelled a long chant, all flyed over, and he flew with his wings on his head. Unlike the other birds, the sound of sounds came, and the more they got together, the place where the two were located into a black shadow. Wei Chihuo laughed at the drop: &ldquo;Smile brother, it turned out to be a woman&rsquo;s cavity. It seemed to make a crow and play, and when did I get my belly? I also taught me to pay attention to my ears, forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were not over. Just as the Yin Yin was not resting, the laughter cited with a long smile, banging, just like the sunny day of the thunderbolt, the mountains collapsed, and the wind turned color. It was scared that the birds in the air were in a chaos, flying around, and disturbing a ball. Some were scared to bury their heads into their wings, unable to hold themselves, and fell to the ground. Someone who broke out of the siege turned his head, tightened his wings, and lost the group like shuttle, flying around. Wei Chihuo also felt that he couldn&rsquo;t stand, and shouted, &ldquo;Smile brother, hurry up, this is not playing, laughing again, my ears are deaf!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Monk Monk also hurriedly stopped: &ldquo;Oh! Oh! I only care about it for a while and bet with you, but I accidentally injured many birds and birds. Master knows, how is it good? &quot;</p>
<p>Then, he said,&rdquo; I used Master to pass on a congenital spirit, and practiced a long smile. Each sound can indeed shock the beasts and deteriorate the birds. How can you use the rigid and soft voice, not only the tiger and leopard, but the monkeys do not see one? I do n’t believe it is within a hundred miles, and I do n’t even have a tiger and leopard. &quot;</p>
<p>In the middle of the saying, when I heard a lot like a Hong Zhong, I ran a long hair full of long hair from the foot of the mountain, wearing a leopard skin, and holding a short and short man in hand. Xiao Zi Mao Xiaoya donkey, screaming here, scared my brother! &quot; The monk laughed first saw the man&rsquo;s costume, shaped like a savage, thinking that the multi -ethnic groups in this area must be a mountain people and the like. I wanted to make a joke with him. And listening to his speaking accent, he was actually a Han. Presumably, he must laughed and shocked others. He was wrong, and he didn&rsquo;t care about him. Wei Chihuo grabbed the man&rsquo;s hand in the early manner and drank: &quot;</p>
<p>Wherever the savage comes from, the exit hurts people, and he will fight, and wait for me to teach you.&rdquo; Suddenly, he came to desperately find revenge. However, it was not expected that when he fell down, there was no trace in front of the figure, but at the same time, he was caught by a black -faced little Taoist. With each other, no one took it. As soon as the man was in a hurry, he started his left hand oolong&rsquo;s claws and grabbed his face. He couldn&rsquo;t have any martial arts. Wei Chihuo only tilted his body and captured him with his left hand. Because of seeing the man is too fierce and asked, he used heavy weapons to hurt people regardless of the green soap and white. This puppet would change to others. I wanted to fall him down, and asked him to come. However, he didn&rsquo;t know that the man had a belly and his natural power. Although he caught his hands and trembled hard without shaking. Wei Chihuo moved in his heart, a lot of tech, tightened his hands, and moved to his arms first. The left arm was crooked, and his right foot stepped on the right foot, followed by the capture method, and when the right arm was black snake plate, the cover had always had a left wrist. The legs are bent on the right knee, leaning forward. At the same time, he risen to the left and dotted the man right. The man who is fulfilling that the person will be difficult to accept, and it will definitely fall to the ground. Who knows that the man looks stupid, but his heart is smart. Wei Chi Hui took a step, and he drank, his arms shocked up at the same time, and he almost broke his hands by the man. The man was not just a lot of strength. Wei Chihuo even used many tricks to avoid it by the man&rsquo;s random response, and his heart was surprised.  The laughter saw the person from the side that the person was out of foolishness, and his bones were extraordinary. Seeing that Wei Chihuo fell, he didn&rsquo;t fall. He laughed and said, &quot;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for a smile here, how can I scare people to death? Don&rsquo;t you fight with my brother first, why not say something No? If I was scared to death, how can I save him back? &ldquo;The man caught his hands by Wei Chihuo and spent a while, remembering the friends who were frightened in the mountain hole in my heart, but the love of the small underworld, but I didn&rsquo;t want to fight, I was anxious to go back to watch, I couldn&rsquo;t get rid of it, and my neck was so anxious. When he heard this, he still struggled with Wei Chihuo, and scolded in his mouth: &quot;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all your two thieves! When my mother was in, I said that I was very powerful, afraid of killing people, and never moved with people. When Shi Cai was not dark, my brother was getting sick and heard you bald thieves. He said that he came to the Phoenix. I helped him out to see that it was your bald thief called. , I have recruited a group of black crickets, and my brother also likes it. He doesn&rsquo;t recognize you, but knows your surnamed Sun. You are saying hello, but you are mourning. My brother is better. At that time, it scared to death. I took my brother back to the hole, took the tiger&rsquo;s cricket, killed you, and gave my brother to the dead. But you dare not do it, but let the black ghost grasp the man with a ghost. You told him to let go and go back as me. Seeing that my brother was like that day, he died for a long time, and did he come back? If you live, I listen to my mother&rsquo;s death, don&rsquo;t want your two thieves. If I do n’t die, I will fight with you. You do it first, finish me, I will hit you and the black ghost. Whoever kills is not allowed to cry, and it ’s not a good man.&rdquo; Speaking of this Wei Chihuo had heard the reason. Weyi was sparse, and his hands were loosened. He had already broken his hand by the man, turned his head, and just like a bird, he went down at dozens of high cliffs on the side. Several jumps one after another, and after entering the cliff early, there was no shadow.  Wei Chihuo did not chase, looked back at the monk, and did not know where he went. He knew that he was chased with the invisible method, and he followed him. After arriving at the cliff, I heard someone talking in a low acupoint next to the mountain stone. At first glance, the place was not large, and the light was dark. On a large bluestone near the door, many clothes were placed in chaos, and a teenager was lying on it. The man shouted twice, agreed, sang, and rushed out of the cave. As soon as I got out of the hole, I saw a flash of shadows in the face, and the monk showed up. The man was taken aback, and when he saw his face, he was jealous, and he fought. The laughed monk flashed slightly, and he reached behind him. The person learned well for the first time, and he didn&rsquo;t get in the end. As soon as he was empty, he did not wait for his head to land, and he looked back early to find the enemy. At first glance, the monk&rsquo;s attitude was peaceful, with a smile on his face, standing behind him, the second time he got his head, and was avoided by the laughed monk as the way. The man would be a sting, just waving and pouring the wind. The monk laughed did not return his hands, only surrounded the person&rsquo;s body. Under the moonlight, he turned straight, and he thought about it. Wei Chihuo&rsquo;s sleeve looked at him, and couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, causing the man to be so anxious. If you do n’t know, you ca n’t do it, you ca n’t, so angry that you will throw it to the ground: &quot;</p>
<p>I do n’t kill you, I ca n’t solve the hatred. In this way, you can hit me first, I will never hide . After playing, I will hit you again. If you do this, you hiding in the sky, and I have to chase you to kill you. Isn&rsquo;t it troublesome? &ldquo;Laughing and laughing:&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have no grievances with you, why bother to fight Are you so dead? &ldquo;The man said angrily:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really said to you, I have been beaten since I was a child. My head, often hitting the mountain, you can&rsquo;t beat me. I am too slippery because you are too slippery. Hei Ghost is not a good person, and then came up with this idea. You hit me without death, but I killed you at once, wouldn&rsquo;t I report my revenge? &ldquo;The Monk said,&rdquo;</p>
<p>You told me all the things, would I pay it back? Going to you? I don&rsquo;t hit you, you are embarrassed to hit me, how good. &ldquo;The man became more and more angered,&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are right. Why do I tell you my idea? Now you don&rsquo;t hit me, you don&rsquo;t hit me, I can&rsquo;t hit you. You have an idea and let me hit you, how about it? &ldquo;The Monk said,&rdquo;</p>
<p>How fresh. Why are I so cheap and impatient, let you hit me? &quot;
The man watched the enemy on the side.</p>
<p>He was afraid that the monk had run away, and when the monk turned slightly, he stopped, and he was always empty, and he was sweating.</p>
<p>Wei Chihuo just watched with a smile.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, the Monk Monk estimated that the man had grinded the man&rsquo;s anger enough, and then said with a smile: &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just stop me. I can&rsquo;t stop it. Even the shadow wants to catch up. You only get one thing in me, and I will save your brother, how about it? &quot;</p>
<p>The man heard the words and said doubtful:&rdquo; If people are out of breath, it will be called to death. My mother. When I died, I found how many people and how many doctors I asked for, and I did n’t save it. In the end, I buried her. I have heard you say that I have not believed it. My brother is out of anger and you will save ? As long as he can live, I will listen to you all the way to the earth. &quot;</p>
<p>Smile Monk said:&rdquo; So, and don&rsquo;t say anything else, save people first, how about it? &quot;</p>
<p>The man heard the words,&rdquo; That Dare to love. But I do n’t coax you. I ca n’t catch you now. It ’s here that there is no cover here. There is no way out of the hole. When you do n’t live, you can only stop the hole when you do n’t live. Come out. I will explain to you now, save you regret. &quot;</p>
<p>The Monk of Xiao ignored him and walked into the cave. The man really stopped the door and looked at the monk to Shi to do it. When people could not save, they got revenge.  In fact, the smile monk had already entered the hole with him. At a glance, he saw the young man who was dead on the bluestone, and even the dwarf was unusual and was shocked. I thought: &ldquo;How can there be such a two unprecedented beauty between the wild mountain valleys? This time, the master has accumulated a merit, Master said that the accumulation is not as good as a person. , Master ’s mantle, no one inherits. The qualifications of these two are not below the Chinese people. This teenager is only qi deficiency after illness, fainted, and not really dead. Why not do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wei Chihuo made a look at him, so that he should not be too much. He fiddled with the dwarf for a while, and went into the hole to see the boy. After many times, he had a micro interest. Take out the elixir given by Master, put it in the import, and cross the mouth, and cross the mouth. Dan medicine turned into Yuanjin, running with Qi, and went straight into the abdomen. In less than a moment, I heard the man shouting, &ldquo;Kill me too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly woke up immediately. He was struggling to sit up, and the monk laughed quickly and said, &ldquo;You have a new illness, you need to raise it, and keep your eyes first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he said, he took him a pill. The teenager felt that the elixir was fragrant at the entrance. As soon as he arrived, he went down, a heating, and reached Yongquan. He was sick in February, and he woke up and felt comfortable, knowing that he was rescued. When he was going to call someone, the young man at the first sight of the teenager turned back to life, threw his hands early, rushed up, and laughed with his head: &ldquo;Brother, you are really alive! This little monk is really a good person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The teenager said: &ldquo;Two My brother is talking nonsense. Fool brothers are ill, although the second brother of Mongolia is supported, it is difficult to look good. At this time, I feel that my whole body is brisk and free, and it seems that the real Buddha is rescued. Worship thanks before. &quot;</p>
<p>The man heard the words, agreed in panic, immediately hit the stone to get the fire, and ignited a beam of looseness. Shi Wei Chi Huo also came in. He walked over and worshiped towards the two of the Monk and Wei Chihuo. The monk laughed no longer fun and helped him up. The humanity: &ldquo;You are really a living immortal, wake up my elder brother. I would offend you, please do n’t see it. What do you want to do? You say, my brother is alive, as long as you do n’t leave him, you will listen to you. The monk said: &quot;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the matter now, you can&rsquo;t talk about it now, and you say that your brother is named his surname.&rdquo; The humanity: &quot;</p>
<p>My mother&rsquo;s surname, I also follow the surname, the name is Fengzi. My brother&rsquo;s surname Zhou This is you. I don&rsquo;t tell the truth about others. &ldquo;The Monk Monk knew that he and the teenager were not brothers. Seeing that he was so bloody to friends and became more surprised. The man had to say that he had done it with the young man named Zhou, and the teenager had said on the stone: &quot;</p>
<p>My brother is naive and slow, the two Engong, let me say.&rdquo; Go over. The teenager was about to get up again, and the monk stopped: &quot;</p>
<p>Although you took the elixir, the vitality was too losing, and it was necessary to restore it after three hours. You can speak at this time, and don&rsquo;t move. It may be done. It is best to eat some porridge. &ldquo;The teenager also felt hungry in his belly, so he asked Shang Fengzi, but what would you eat. Shang Fengzi replied: &quot;</p>
<p>My brother wants to eat, it&rsquo;s really good, happy to die. I still told me to sell your clothes for one or two dollars, buy some rice, and boil a pot of vegetable porridge. I ca n’t eat it, I ’m sad, I do n’t eat it, I stay there, I will cook it for you.&rdquo;  After that, I went to cook porridge, but said in my mouth: &quot;</p>
<p>My brother is fine, and there are two good people and friends. This month, the beasts of the silkworm ridge are dead. Can&rsquo;t get one. I don&rsquo;t eat it a few days, it doesn&rsquo;t matter. These two good people and friends must have not eaten yet, and save my brother, what to give people to eat? It&rsquo;s really hard to die. &quot; Recently, the beasts in the mountains have been extinct. It can be seen that there was something before. I think of the things of Shi talent. It is strange. The young man said because of Shang Fengzi, and also remembered that because of Shangfengzi&rsquo;s food volume, he first hit the beasts to eat. Since the beast is extinct, he and he have worked hard for more than a month. I couldn&rsquo;t help but anxious. The Monk Monk saw his meaning and said, &quot;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry first. I&rsquo;m vegetarian, don&rsquo;t eat it, it&rsquo;s okay. My brother can eat it. We can be hungry for ten days and eight days. You talk about clothing and deeds, face palms, and you must have a rich family. How can you come here? You can say it in detail. If it is difficult, I may help you with one arm, and it is not known. &ldquo;The teenager heard that he couldn&rsquo;t think of it. , I have to stand on the pillow, indicating. As soon as the monk laughed, it turned out that the teenager was not an outsider, but Zhou Yuncong, who was a new disciple who was a drunk Taoist, said that he had passed and became happy.  It turned out that Zhou Yuncong in the first episode, since being trapped in Ciyun Temple. In the night of the wind and thunderstorm, he escaped from the Longtan Tiger Point. He went to the Qiu Lin family of God&rsquo;s eyes, and met the Emei School drunk. Because Zhang&rsquo;s father and daughter fought from the heart of the cloud, the drunk Taoist was cut, and the fate cloud assigned the marriage family from Zhang Nuyuzhen, and gave him a bite of Frost Tan Jian, which was a gift with Yu Zhen. The drunk Taoist wanted to discuss the Ci Cloud Temple in the Bi Yizhen Fairy Xianxia. He hurriedly passed on to getting started from a sword method, and then don&rsquo;t go. After Yun and Zhang&rsquo;s father and daughter sent the drunk Taoist, to the next day, Yun went from four to his hometown from the master and servant and Zhang&rsquo;s father and daughter. On the way, Zhang&rsquo;s father and daughter were guarded, and there was no accident. In the reaching Guiyang, Zhang Laoben wanted to find a shop first. Later, because Yun died in the same year in the same year, he went home halfway. Although he did not accompany his peers in advance, there were a lot of inconvenience. After a while, he still went to the same. At the moment, Yun Cong called Xiao San&rsquo;er to ride a fast horse, first go to his parents, and rectify the inner room to prepare for Yuzhen.  Yun Cong&rsquo;s father and son, since Yun left, for a few days, it was unknown why he felt shocked and restlessly. The nine of their brothers were very friendly, and the nine room was only one son, all of which were anxious about the cloud from entering Beijing. Judong regrets that he is like a family wealth and the descendants of Shuxiang. Yun has already had a reputation, and he is not a white Ding. He only cares about it for a while. What is good if there is such a loss? Nine brothers, only when they met, they were all talking about Yun from Beijing. Zi Jing also said that he has recently dreamed of ominous, and often has a warning. The child from the child did not say that the old family Wang Fu was older, and he taught him not to feel bad about silver money. When he met the person on the road, he went home. At the beginning of the road, there is still a peaceful letter. In the past many days, there are no faiths, so it ’s so relieved. Everyone heard the words and was anxious for a while. Zi Jing said: &quot;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not too early today. If there is no message tomorrow, I will send people to bring more silver money, and they will catch up. I asked that person to follow the photos. Inquiring about the merchants along the way, spending it at any time, ask him to return to the letter at any time. If there is no convenience, it will be half a month limit, even if a special person travels, the information cannot be interrupted. &quot; So. Although Brother Zhou was not separated, he lived nearby, and he was divided into a day. He also took turns to eat several times a month. Every day, everyone was in a poor mood and went back separately.
Zi Jing was worried about Jiaochou.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he saw Xiao San&rsquo;er full of dust, holding a whip with one hand, and hurried in.</p>
<p>At first sight, the couple&rsquo;s husband and wife turned around and remembered that many alarms the day before yesterday were shocked.</p>
<p>Xiao San&rsquo;er ran too anxiously, and shouted the people who stood beside him out.</p>
<p>Yifa called Zi Jing&rsquo;s husband and wife to be panicked.</p>
<p>No one dared to speak first and asked if his son was safe.</p>
<p>Xiao San&rsquo;er was clever, seeing the owner anxious, the first sentence called people out, and the second sentence said, &ldquo;Master Wan An! The son is back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Going home, it seems that a pearl fell on the sky, and was overjoyed. He was busy asking where his son is now. Seeing that Xiao San&rsquo;er had retreated from the industry, he went forward and lowered: &ldquo;The son is in trouble, and he is born and died. Duo Meng&rsquo;s old hero named Zhang was rescued. Now he escorted his son to go home safely. He was not far from home. He was not far away. Xiao&rsquo;s return to report the letter. Zhang Lao Hero has a girl, asking the master to order people to clean up the two rooms first. When the son comes back, I will tell everything in detail. &quot;</p>
<p>Zi Yan heard the words, shocked and happy, and called people to clean up the house. He also asked people to send letters with the eight brothers, and couldn&rsquo;t help asking Xiao Saner&rsquo;s details. Xiao San&rsquo;er panicked: &ldquo;How many things are there, the son said that you should not say for the time being, and wait for the son to meet, first clean up the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zi Xun heard helplessness, so he told his wife Yang to order the house to clean up the house, took Xiao San&rsquo;er himself, and went to the door to wait and see. Looking at the dusk, the sky was getting dark, and then he saw that Yun came from the same old man and a girl riding. Xiao San&rsquo;er hurriedly greeted and pulled the horse chewing ring. From the first sight of his father, he stared at his father, remembered the past, and couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sad. He stepped forward and saluted. At this time, Zijing had learned some of the time from the mouth of Xiao San&rsquo;er, and quickly called, and his body was beside him. There are small three children and the people who have established three people&rsquo;s luggage to develop a handle. The son and son of the son of Zhang led Zhang&rsquo;s father and daughter to the inner hall. Yun Cong&rsquo;s mother also had to rush out. When she met, she hugged Yun from her arms regardless of her. Zi Jing known that Zhang&rsquo;s father and daughter are heroes in the dust, and they have not introduced it yet. While calling his wife, he greeted Zhang&rsquo;s fourth father and daughter. From the coming, Yun met his father, and he watched his son first when he got up. Then he bowed to Zhang&rsquo;s father and daughter and said, &ldquo;The child is not filial, because he is not resistant to the long -distance wind and frost, and then think of his parents and uncle, and walk halfway and rush home. The father -in -law of Meng Zhang&rsquo;s family and Sister Yu Zhen disregarded their body. From Hongtao Hongtao, she saved the child from the danger. Because Sister Yuzhen saved the child to save people, she forgot the suspects of men and women. Xian Chang made a forth, hired Sister Yuzhen as his wife, escorted all the way, and hoped that his father and mother forgive the child to be engaged from power. All the situations should be detailed after a while. &quot;</p>
<p>Zi Jing was also very alert. Seeing that Yun said from what he said, he did not consistent with the words of the younger child. Yun Cong&rsquo;s mother put Yun Cong and saw a woman with beautiful and beautiful and beautiful gods at a glance. She was praised. And the Jing heard that Yun Cong&rsquo;s wife was a life -saving benefactor. She also saw that she followed her father to her father. After the words were finished, he pulled up and sat next to him, sitting beside him, and asked her how she saved Yun Cong, and asked the long and short. When Yu Zhen never told Yun from the future, she knew that there were many places to avoid people&rsquo;s eyes; she had not passed the door, and when she first saw her mother -in -law, she was inconvenient to say that she was embarrassed. It happened that Yun finished speaking, and Zi Jing greeted his wife: &ldquo;When you are hired by your daughter -in -law, you are afraid of asking for a long time when you have something to do. The mother reminded that she also forgot to worship the benevolent, and quickly gave up Yuzhen. As the Zizong passed, the couple worshiped. Zhang Laosi quickly kneeled down and worshiped. Yun looked at Chao Yuzhen, and the young couple kneeling with their parents. Zi Jingkou said: &quot;</p>
<p>Hanmen is thin, nine brothers, only one son. This time, he should not be eager to fame and treat the long road. The ancestor&rsquo;s blood food will also be interrupted because of the interruption. And Mongolian&rsquo;s family did not give up, booked a marriage, and escorted it in person. Xiang Shuang knew gifts, not to be proud of wealth, and became more and more rejoicing for her daughter for life. She was happy and humble. Everyone worshiped and got up.  Yun from her mother always wanted to ask for details. Seeing her son Jinglian&rsquo;s eyes, she couldn&rsquo;t bear her heart, so she respectfully said: &ldquo;The daughter -in -law is far away, and the talented Xiao Saner&rsquo;s words did not understand. Does she do not? The young man did not want to sing her. You can talk with your relatives. I will take a look at her. &quot;</p>
<dl>
<dt>Then, two sentences with Zhang Laosi, pulled Yuzhen, and walked inside. Yu Zhenwan couldn&rsquo;t think of such a good love, but his in -laws were so loving, and he had long been full of love. Understand the meaning of the mother -in -law&rsquo;s words, when she smiled, she helped Yun from her mother with her hands and walked back. Seeing her from her mother was so generous, she was so unhappy. Mother -in -law and daughter -in -law likes to enter inside. Not mentioned.  Zi Jing and Yun Cong accompanied Zhang Laosi to see the house, choose a good residence, and retreat. Yun Cong couldn&rsquo;t help crying in the early morning. He stepped forward and knelt down again. He escaped in Ci Yun Temple in danger. Duo Mengyuzhen rescued him. Although Zixing had conservation, he couldn&rsquo;t help but deeply affection, his heart was cut, and his tears were flowing. Now I thanked Zhang Laosi a few words. Because all of them are abolished, each of them stays in Chongqing, and it is inevitable that there will be no great entanglement in the sun. It feels that it is inappropriate to say and conceal it. After discussing for a while, we still concealed it for the time being. Everyone thought about the same words. The subordinates have prepared the wine and waited for the host. Zi Jing knew that it was not too early, and others used meals. Yun should be seen from the uncle of the houses. Because of the large number of people, Yun Cong was in addition to it again. Fortunately, everyone is friendly, watching the cloud from being born, and can be eaten in the same time. Come to reunite. The plan has been determined. From his mother&rsquo;s ordered Xiao San&rsquo;er, the wine and rice have been placed in the inner hall. Zi Xun heard the words, and when he thought about it, he invited Zhang Laosi to enter. Yun followed, and at a glance, she saw her mother crying red and swollen. She knew that Yu Zhen had already understood the truth and couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sad. Early, the mother and son were crying again. Zhang&rsquo;s father and daughter repeatedly comforted.  Although everyone remembered the past feelings, it was very distressed, but things had passed. Yun returned from still, and had a beautiful heroine as a wife. Yun Cong and Yu Zhen are a couple who have suffered from dilemma. Yu Zhen should be calm and answering. This meal is very cheerful. After eating, the industry is almost midnight. Zi Jing only remembered that he only cared and laughed, and forgot to send a happy letter to your brothers. If you are invited at this time, everyone is asleep. Maybe I have to come here. There are too many people to say that there are too many people. And the late night, shocked the elderly, was also inconsistent. The decision was to go to Yun from Yun from the door. If you want to decide, he told Yun from his mother. Yun from his mother heard the words, and couldn&rsquo;t help but &ldquo;嗳&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>
<p>&ldquo;We only care about talking, and we will forget the matter. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you don&rsquo;t have a little brother. With the joy, won&rsquo;t you be angry, wouldn&rsquo;t she recruit her? &quot;</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Zi Jing said:&rdquo; Although the second sister is confused, the second brother still understands. My brother nine, all read the reason. This is night now, and his potential can not be killed. The son -in -law went to her house. I told you the details tomorrow. Even though the second sister saw the strangeness, the second brother may not be the case. Let&rsquo;s go with him. &quot;</p>
<p>Zi Jing talked with Zhang Laosi and discussed that Yun from the husband and wife&rsquo;s coincidence, and did not go to bed until San even passed. Yun Cong&rsquo;s mother dial two girls to serve Yuzhen. That night, she called Yuzhen to sleep with herself. Father and son and daughter -in -law will inevitably have a lot of words in bed.
Early on the second day, Yun got up and was preparing to meet the respects of each house.</p>
<p>As soon as he washed, he saw the servant report.</p>
<p>The couple of Zijing also believed that the father and son and his son and his wife hurriedly greeted them, and the brothers had gone in.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zi Jing came, the eight brothers and concubines such as Da, San, Five, and Sixth, the four -bedroom couples such as the second, four, eight, and nine were not yet arrived.</p>
<p>On the one hand, when I saw it, I asked people to send a letter separately.</p>
<p>Zi Jing&rsquo;s elder brother Xiu said with a funny: &ldquo;Lao Qi, don&rsquo;t want to Zhang Luo, we don&rsquo;t know that Yuner returned first, or last night, the second brother asked from the house to inquire, saying that someone saw Yun&rsquo;er returning, Lao Qi You have never sent a letter? I guess that Yun&rsquo;er returned too late. You are afraid that he will not be able to come, so I do n’t call Yun&rsquo;er. I think Yuner has lack of long -distance labor. If he asked him to ask An Hui, it would be too much. So I got the information and was busy asking people to separate and say to everyone. I ordered to eat and reunite in your side early in the morning. I couldn&rsquo;t listen to it. When I came, I shouted the third brother, the fifth brother, and the sixth brothers, and asked someone to urge the second child. Presumably it would come. &quot;</p>
<p>Zixiu was a elder brother, who was very upright and the brothers were most respected. Puttering the clouds, not biological. After listening to this, Yun Cong was busy and thanked Dad&rsquo;s love. Just standing, Zi Jing&rsquo;s second brother Hua Hua, Four Brother Fan, Eight Disciples, and Nine Disciples also came one after another. Only Zihua was a single person, and the rest of them were couples. Everyone has seen the courtesy. Zi Hua&rsquo;s face was red and said, &ldquo;You two moved the fetal gas last night, and today it is a bit uncomfortable, so in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun heard the words from his mother, and glanced at Zi Zi, and said, &ldquo;When I was young, Yun&rsquo;er watched it. See what happened to his second mother? &quot;</p>
<p>He asked Zihua again,&rdquo; Can you ask the doctor to see it? &quot;</p>
<p>Zihua just agreed. Yun Cong was a son in the incense of the nine -bedroom room. All the strengths came, and they were busy asking An Yan&rsquo;s words. The reunion of the family is very happy. Yu Congzhao passed in front of the leaders in front of the leaders. Only after Yun, accompanied by Yun from her mother, attracted Yuzhen to meet. The new Master Zhang Si was also introduced outside. Men and women make two banquets.  After the seat, Yun was going to explore the illness in Zihua&rsquo;s family, and the quilt blocked again and again, saying, &ldquo;Yun returned from the beginning, your second mother had no serious illness, and it would be late to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Cong asked several times. The quilt Hua stopped. For a while, I didn&rsquo;t feel it. It was a night banquet. Everyone agreed during the dinner that in the recent period, Choji and Yun Cong&rsquo;s husband and wife co -armed. It was not until the night that it went back separately.  In the early morning of the second day, Yun Cong went to the Zihua family to visit the disease. He saw Zihua alone, and Zihua&rsquo;s wife Cui did not see it. When I was out of the door, I saw a person standing at the door of the room outside, and gave birth to a ape bee waist. The face was like Fu Fan. Seeing the cloud came out, he flashed into the room. Yun did not make a meeting from the time, and went to the uncle&rsquo;s house by the way. These uncle are all old -age children. Except for Zihua, Yun from each family, he must keep it for a while, and he did not go home until the middle of the night. From knowing the aunts of all the aunts, only the second mother, Cui, was a new marry of the string. She was not born high, and she was not in line with her. She was afraid that her parents would not be happy. I went twice in a row and never saw it. When you arrive at Yun from the happy period, Cui is near the childbirth period, let alone come. At this time, the old family Wang Fu, who had recovered the industry. Yun has been discouraged from the difficulties. Because it was a teacher, Yu Zhen had the grace of life -saving, so he followed his marriage. Although the couple are deeply affectionate, the boudoir is weak. I no longer study every day. In view of the danger of the previous out of the house, Uncle Yun Cong&rsquo;s parent, he had no unwilling reputation, and everything was free.  Less than a month later, Cui gave birth to a son. In this case, Zhou&rsquo;s gate has added a new bud, not only everyone is happy, but also more clouds. Zihua Da Zhangyan feast, made three dynasties, and made a full moon. Relatives and friends have to believe in congratulations, and they will be lively after they are married. After three days after Yu Zhen&rsquo;s marriage, Zeng Suiyun saw the respects from each room. Only Cui Lin was Linyue. He pushed the birth of a person within a hundred days. Essence Yu Zhen didn&rsquo;t care about it first, and on the day of the full moon, Zhu Yan still failed to meet with Cui. When I went home in the evening, when she was leaning, Yu Zhen was about to get on the sedan, and glanced at the young man with the ape -bee -hoe he saw the day before yesterday. When I went home and asked Yun Cong, Yun Cong said: &ldquo;Before entering the table during the day, I also saw that person. Everyone thought that relatives and friends who were not commonly met, but did not care. But they had seen that person lived in the second when he returned home. In the Bo family, I feel strange. Seasons of the dictation, while the second uncle sent the guests to turn around, he welcomed him and wanted to ask the person who was his relatives and friends. Rising and red, I want to speak. I turned my head and saw that the man was standing not far beside him, staring at himself, looking at himself, and his face was not good -looking. At the same time, Erbo also walked around and didn&rsquo;t care about it. Ask. &quot;</p>
<p>Yu Zhen heard the words, and was busy inviting her father to come in, and said the past. Zhang Laosi heard the words and was shocked: &ldquo;As the daughter said, the man was the party feather of Ciyun Temple. Jump, busy asking exactly. Zhang Laosi said: &quot;</p>
<p>I lived in Chengdu at the beginning, and I thought Zhitong was a monk with a precepts. It wasn&rsquo;t until two years later that he could see that he could not wait without heaven, and I wanted to avoid them. One for many years washing hands, there was not much savings, and there was a lot of savings. Reconstruction, it is not easy. It ’s temporarily invading, and it will continue. One day, I went to Wudan Mountain to hunt back with my daughter and met a strong man. Internal. Walking across each other, he watched my father and daughter alone. The second day Zhitong came to find out my breath and invited me to join the group. When the person came to meet, it would be a way to see the mountain and make me unable to depend. I thanked me again and again, saying that I was old and aged, and martial arts were sparse. At this time, I only asked for my own efforts, and I would never have his own aspirations. I pointed out that the day of the day, never bad things in his temple, and leaked the wind at all, and then people sent it in the future. Later, the more I thought about it, the more strange. When I was young, although I was famous for full, I only won the martial arts. Hidden, not only like me who suffers from worrying and experienced, you never dare to risk to lightly lighten the tiger&rsquo;s beard; At that time, although he did not join the parties, he talked with the well -known monk, and often came and went, and slowly inquired about their intentions, and knew that the man was leaked. The man was named Biyi Xiangxiang Min Xiaotang, and he was the son of Zhitong. My master and I have a few sides of the thieves and I have a few sides. When I first saw him, I was only fourteen or five years old, so I didn&rsquo;t recognize it. He knew my details. He saw Zhen&rsquo;er at the temple gate, got up badly, said to Zhitong, planned to be a companion, and then presided over the media by Zhitong. I was rejected. If the good name is outside, he refuses to have trouble near Chengdu. I do n’t dare to do his business. Min thieves have left and let go. I know the truth. , I have to bear it, and then talk about it. One side secretly savings the two, and the home is abandoned to avoid; I borrowed some money from the vegetable garden and bought a dozen acres of land nearby, and tried to operate, pretending to be a long time to avoid their doubts. Soon I fled with you here. At first I only knew that the thief went out and committed the crime. I didn&rsquo;t want to be narrow in the enemy. It was in your house. This was a pair of strange eyes, and it was the most true. He was very good at first. For example, he learned swordsmanship from Zhitong, and even my father and daughter were not rivals. For the current plan, only pretending to be ignored, and he was secretly lingering. How can I be born close to the house, and I can know that his origin is intended. I went secretly and recognized him. If it was him, I couldn&rsquo;t say that I would have to come to the classmate like the teacher to pay. &quot;</p>
