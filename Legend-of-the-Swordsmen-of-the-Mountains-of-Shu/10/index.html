<p>He entered the school at the age of fifteen, and he raised at the age of eighteen.</p>
<p>The ranking was high.</p>
<p>After he was in the middle, he did not satisfy himself, and now he will enter Beijing for work and wait for the exam.</p>
<p>Although his father, his uncle, was not assured because of the long journey, and saw that Yun was well -famed, and he could not stop him from moving.</p>
<p>He had to pick a powerful old man Wang Fu, and the book boy Xiaosan&rsquo;er, accompanied the cloud to enter Beijing together.</p>
<p>After choosing Jiri, Yun Cong&rsquo;s uncle and uncle&rsquo;s parents walked with relatives and friends, and brought Wang Fu and Xiao San&rsquo;er to start.</p>
<p>After a few days, I met a few of the same year on the road.</p>
<p>They all entered Beijing early in the same day and were waiting for the science field.</p>
<p>There is a companion along the way, not lonely.</p>
<p>Later, the more people got together, and there were 17 people who went to Beijing in total.</p>
<p>This group of young people are mostly expensive, and most of them are happy.</p>
<p>At the moment, Yun said from the suggestion: &ldquo;If we arrive in Beijing, we still have several months of idleness. The ancients read thousands of books and do thousands of miles, and experience and learning are equal. Just go to the tour, isn&rsquo;t it a trek? &quot;</p>
<p>In the inside, when he was named Song, he said,&rdquo; The old brother, I agree with it. How many days to play? &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone was young and fun, and there was no objection. If you discuss the stop, he will ask the followers to carry your luggage, advance in Cheng, and gather in Chongqing. They were sixteen, and in addition to Yun, they brought a small package with a small package and went straight around to Chengdu. Wang Fu is afraid that they will not go out, deceived, and repeatedly persuaded. Song Shi said: &ldquo;I have been walking outside for ten years. I understand any road on the rivers and lakes. You can only rest assured that the old housekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wang Fu couldn&rsquo;t stop it, and knew that it was a big road to Chengdu. It was very quiet and had to be by him. Calling Xiao San&rsquo;er again, and told him again and again that he would wait for the little owner sooner or later, do not have trouble. Although Xiao San&rsquo;er was young, he was quite alert and agreed one by one. Then start separately. Sixteen people have nothing to do all the way, joyful, in Chengdu, found a big guest store, and went to the place where they were famous every day, swimming.  One day, Yun went out from the same people and played for a while, and proposed to go to Wangjiang Tower to drink. They have been here twice a few days ago, because except for three or four of them are Han Shi, they are all wealthy children, and they don&rsquo;t love money. Seeing that the wine insurance is the arrival of a good master, it is naturally doubled. Yun&rsquo;s proposal does not enter the elegant seat. Each four or three sitting on a table, drinking with the column, you can look at the Yangtze River. There was no objection to the big furniture, so he asked Jiu Bao to wrap the seat of the window. Whoever wants to lean against the window has only four tables. One of the tables is already a Taoist who lie there for a few times there, and Song Bao called the man to call the man. Seeing that the person was poor, he came in to drink in the morning, and did not leave until the afternoon. There was no guest before, and I didn&rsquo;t care much about it. Now I look at many wealth gods who want this. Of course, I feel more straightforward. Then asked them to sit on the three tables, walked over and called the person twice, but did not agree. Then he pushed the man twice, not only did the man not awake, but snoring loudly. In Song Shi, in this small tour group, it was a very manifestation. When he saw this situation, he could not help but fire and was waiting to speak. Suddenly the man yawned and said, &ldquo;A gourd wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, he looked up and saw that he was sleeping with a red gourd with a wine. Seeing the person who wanted to wine, the wine bun said, &ldquo;Dao, do you still drink? You came in early in the morning and had already drank those wines. Don&rsquo;t drink bad your body. According to me, you should go back to the temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Tao Humanity: &ldquo;Fart! Do you open the hotel, don&rsquo;t you allow me to drink? Take the soap, take my gourd and take the wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wine guarantee promised &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;</p>
<p>, and lost his face with a smile, and said to the person, &quot; Taoist, Xiao&rsquo;s plan to ask for a little thing. &quot;</p>
<p>Taoist humanity:&quot; I am a poor Taoist, what do you ask me? &quot;</p>
<p>Jiu Bao said:&quot; Our four tables, yesterday, I was settled to more than a dozen Xianggong. Say it is this time today. Come and drink in the morning. I think you will go after drinking, so let you give you. Now the people who set the seat are here. Please let you let, go over there. The Taoist listened, and said angrily: &quot;</p>
<p>People drink and give money, I also give money when I drink? Why do you mobilize it? If you set it for others, I should tell me first when I come in. You obviously bully me to monks, Today, your family is drinking here! &quot;  After waiting for half a day, it was impatient. Seeing that the person was poor, his speech was strong, he couldn&rsquo;t help anger, he walked over, and to the humanity: &quot;</p>
<p>This seat was originally determined, if you don&rsquo;t let, you are not rude to the master!&quot; I can&rsquo;t see it, why do I make you? How can you be able to be, you make it. &quot;</p>
<p>Song Shi heard it, and then stepped forward to the face of the person&rsquo;s face. From seeing him and waiting for the quarrel, he was waiting for persuasion. He was too late. He only heard &ldquo;Ah&rdquo;</p>
<p>, and Song Shi was so painful. It turned out that his slap hit the face of the Taoist, just like hitting the iron stone, painful heart and lungs. How did these lips tolerate, said, &ldquo;Reverse! Reverse! Drag him out, beat him half to death, and send offer officers to sin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was standing together, Yun Zhi stopped him, and said, &ldquo;Everyone is slow, tolerate me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because of this, there was a lot of money with a lot of money, and he was willing to spend his leader. He said this sentence, and everyone had to stop temporarily to see how he paid. When Yun came over, the man had stood up and looked at him carefully. From seeing the man&rsquo;s two eyes, he was shot on the eyes and knew that he was not a leisure. I often hear Wang Fu said that there are many people on the rivers and lakes, and they must not be guilty at will. Then he said to the man: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry with this dealer. We all have all the same year. We come here to drink today. Because everyone wants to sit together and talk, I call the wine to be shocked. It doesn&rsquo;t matter, don&rsquo;t see the strangeness. &quot;</p>
<p>The master said,&rdquo; Which one came to blame you? You see, he hit me, I never returned my hand! &quot;</p>
<p>At this time It&rsquo;s red and swollen. The mouth said, &ldquo;This thief must have a demon method, and it is necessary to send official re -office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Cong woke up quickly and told him not to speak. In the face of Taoist Taoism: &ldquo;Friends crashed into Daoye, I don&rsquo;t know how to make He Xianfa? He is unbearable now, and I hope that the Master is compassionate and convenient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t be able to fight, I will suffer this pain. I have never moved, which fairy method will I move? &quot;  At this time, the owner of the restaurant also knew that he was afraid that the matter was big, and he persuaded him. Later, Yun asked for each other, and the Taoist said, &quot;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to live with the life to die. Because he couldn&rsquo;t beat people, he made the wrong force and bend his tendons. Let him hurt. You call him to come over, and I will give him it. &ldquo;At this time, Song Shi was still scolding thousands of thieves and thief. From the past, he helped him, and Song Shi still scolded. Yun Zhi was afraid of being angry and refused to heal, and persuaded Song to not listen, it was very embarrassing. Who thinks that the man listened to the scolding of Song Shi, and if nothing happened, he opposed Yun Cong: &quot;</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be embarrassed, I don&rsquo;t want to be angry with the dead.&rdquo; In the Song Dynasty, I just rubbed it lightly, and said, &quot;</p>
<p>Okay. Don&rsquo;t reach out to hit people at will next time.&quot; Then, I glanced at Song Shi and sighed slightly. It&rsquo;s a bit infrared, it&rsquo;s not painful or swollen. Yun Cong was afraid he would scold people and pulled him over. Come over again to thank the Taoist, ask Jiu Bao to ask the Taoist to drink or not, and the liquor account is calculated together. Humanistic: &quot;</p>
<p>I have enough wine to drink enough. I only have to have five pounds of wine, and it is enough to make late food.&quot; Yun came from the busy bunker and put it into the Taoist gourd. The man did not thank him, took the gourd, and left his back, and left without returning.  Everyone is very big. Some people say that people are monsters. They say they are deceiving and eating. When someone knows the account, it will not occupy the seat. However, Yun Yun sent the person from the self -made person, and suddenly remembered that he forgot to ask the name of the person, and regardless of the discussion of everyone, he looked at the man alone to see where the man went. I saw the person out of the restaurant, and the pedestrians downstairs were very crowded. However, where the people walked through, no matter how crowded people were, there was one or two feet from him. Essence Because I never asked the name just now, I couldn&rsquo;t help crying, &quot;</p>
<p>Please turn around!&quot; The man walked slowly on the street. After hearing this, he only looked upstairs. Yun from Manchu, who would come back, who thought the person was walking very quickly. At this time, the crowd was noisy for a while, and called him to eat alcohol because he saw Yun dazed from the window. From looking back, Yun looked a little or two a little, and when I looked down, the trace was no longer seen. He had to laugh and laugh with the public for a while. Because of the Song Dynasty, I touched a nail today, and refused to flow. I proposed to return to the store with wine and meals. Everyone knew that he had his heart, and Yu Yun followed his account and went back to the store.
On the second day, I had breakfast, and Song Shi proposed to go to Ciyun Temple outside the city.</p>
<p>This Ciyun Temple is a famous Zen forest in Chengdu, the Corridor of the Temple, the flowers and trees, and it is very elegant.</p>
<p>There are a lot of temples, and monks are easily out of the temple door.</p>
<p>The monks in the temple are abiding by the Qing rules, and the view of Zen is also famous.</p>
<p>Everyone has heard of it for a long time, because there are two or three decades from the city, and there is a village collection next to the temple.</p>
<p>Yun Cong proposed: &ldquo;Chengdu is famous, the tour has been all over, and now there are only this good. I stayed in a shop for a day, and I went to Chongqing tomorrow after swimming after the temple? &quot;</p>
<p>Song Shi had a hard time yesterday, his face was not good -looking, and he wanted to leave Chengdu early. The crowd had no accuracy, and the light car was reduced, bringing Xiao San&rsquo;er together.  When I went to the noon card, there were thirty miles away. There was a village collection and a shop. As soon as I asked Ciyun Temple, I knew that it was not far from this. It turned out that there were most of the people here with temple production. Everyone used a little meal, leaving only Xiao San&rsquo;er to see the house in the store, and all walked to Ciyun Temple. About half a mile, I saw a piece of Maolin, Jiashu onion cage, and appeared on the corner of the red wall. A gust of gusts passed, and the sound of the Sanskrit sound was really clear. Everyone arrived at the temple gate, walked in, entertained by the monk, and took the tea to clear the tea. After a while, they spoke for a while, which led everyone to visit the Buddhist temple in the Buddhist temple. This Zhike, named Yi Yi, is very elegant, entertaining diligence, and waiting for the temper. After walking for half a day, Zhike Monk led another Zen room to rest. This Zen room is very elegant. The famous person&rsquo;s calligraphy and paintings are hung on the wall, and the stationery on the table is very neat. On the western Zen bed, there are two Xiabu futons, saying that it is a static function at night. Everyone wants to ask the abbot to talk about it. One: &ldquo;House teachers Zhitong, cleared in the backyard, declined with dust, and refused to come out easily. Tan Yue, there will be a fate again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone listened, and they all sighed. When he saw a axis painting in Song Dynasty, he had a very unsuccessful status and was about to ask, why he was hung here. Suddenly, a little Sha Mi came in and said, &ldquo;The abbot invites the guest teacher to talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while, he said to everyone: &ldquo;The small temple temple house is twists and turns, and it is easy to get fascinated. You can come back and accompany you, let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say, hurry up.  In the Song Dynasty, he said to Yun: &ldquo;You see the layout in this temple, and the discussion of the monks in the same knowledge, how high and elegant. This Zen room is well -arranged well. Isn&rsquo;t such a painting a feces in the head? &quot;</p>
<p>It turned out that this Zen room was very wide, with windows in the east and door south. On the west wall, there is a banner of Mi Xiangyang&rsquo;s smoke map; on the north wall is Fang Xiaoyu&rsquo;s white stone Qingsong&rsquo;s middle hall, with a pair of couplets next to it. &ldquo;The money is Zhang Yi, a little famous man in Shu. Only in the Zen bed, lonely hanging a middle hall, painted by the eight immortals, the pen is vulgar, and the paper is full of artisan. The crowd had previously only talked with each other, and never noticed. After Song Shiyi, Judi turned back to discuss.  Yun was sitting on the bed, looking back and seeing a hammer below the middle hall, and took it to play. I didn&rsquo;t pay attention, and touched the hem of the eight immortals across the sea hall. About the nail period hanging on it, it was a bit activity. After a shock, a hammer was shocked, and the back was recessed in the back, about one person tall, one foot and three inches wide, and there was a small puppet hanging on it. Everyone did not understand why this 何 should be hidden here. Song Shi was standing in front of the bed, took the hammer from the cloud from his hands to play, and he was so high for a while. He hit the cricket, only listened to it, crispy and listened. So he combined twice. Yun Cong suddenly saw a small monk probe, and said, &quot;</p>
<p>Brother Song, don&rsquo;t be naughty, move people&rsquo;s things, know that the guest is coming, I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo;  Without the words, he listened to three bells, and then there was a rolling sound. At the same time, there was a small door on the wall. There was a gorgeous woman standing in front of the door. When she saw everyone, &quot;</p>
<p>Yeah&rdquo;, he quickly retreated. Song Shi said: &quot;</p>
<p>There was a secret door here, and there were women hiding, and the abbot must not be a good person. Why don&rsquo;t we go in and scold the bald donkey, and to knock him a nail (Sichuan language, that is, the bamboo bar)?&rdquo; Yun Cong said: &quot;</p>
<p>The younger brother is slow. When the younger brother got up at home, the old family Wang Fu once said to the younger brother that no matter whether the temple is at the temple, you can follow the guidance of the people in the temple. Outside the Three Realms, it is not in the five elements. It is clean and silent, and the dust is not stained. There are many people who have adulterated and adultery, and there are many evils. Usually, it is okay not to see his collection. Blessing, why is there an organ in the room and a woman hidden? It is best not to move messy when I wait.  Everyone listened to this seat and was talking about the altar. There is a surname of Shi Shi, and suddenly said, &ldquo;Yun Cong, you just care about talking, how can you see the door behind your head?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the crowd quickly looked back, the one that came in really came in. The door was unknown, and there was only a wall left. The calligraphy and paintings hanging on the wall have no trace. Everyone couldn&rsquo;t help but be surprised, and couldn&rsquo;t help rushing forward to push. I saw that the wall was very strong, just like the dragon&rsquo;s shaking the stone pillar, and I wanted to score. At this time, except for the small door in the Zen bed, there was no door to come out. Everyone was shocked and scared. Yun Cong suddenly said: &ldquo;We are really dull. Now there is no door to come out, there is a window in front of us, why not go out of the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great disappointment. It turned out that although the window had four fans, it had been stunned from the outside. This is not tightened, and these four windows are all raw iron. In addition, the dug -of -the -character pattern has two fingers thickness and red paint on the outside, so it cannot be seen. Everyone jumped and jumped, and went to the wall of the plate. This group of young nobles, then they knew that they were in danger, and the scene was not good. Someone should not hit the puppet in the Song Dynasty, some said that the monks were irregular. There are two bold people who say, &ldquo;We are all raised, and there are many people. We can&rsquo;t help me. When we know that the guests come back, we will always save us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also lively. Yun Cong was noisy by this person, and said, &ldquo;We are here, now we are good and bad, and they are completely unknown. They complain that they are not beneficial. Okay. &quot;</p>
<p>After a word, the room became silent in the room, all frowned, thinking hard. However, when the small door was looking at the small door on the wall, he suddenly said, &ldquo;Brother, I think it’ s a blessing or a disaster, but now there is neither the way, nor people ignore us. OK? According to my opinion, it is better to go in from this small door. When we met the abbot, I simply explained the words with him, indicating that we were inadvertently discovered by the organ and asked him to let us go out. Fortunately, we have not damaged his things, Another person who has passed again, although he sees the secret, will never be legendary with him. I think many of our well -known people, he has such a big courage to kill us together? We only need to get rid of this out of this The temple, the articles in the future, aren&rsquo;t we written by us? &quot;</p>
<p>Everyone listened to this and immediately made a noise for a while. The result of discussing the result, in addition, there is no good law. So the leader was led by Song Shi, and everyone went in together. The small door on the Zen bed was only allowed to enter one person, and everyone followed the fish in the Song Dynasty. After this group of sending the dead team into the door, it went to more than ten steps, which was a long martyrdom, very dark, as if walking in the wall. And every thirty and fifty steps, there is an oil lamp, which virtually discern the path. After walking about a hundred steps, more than ten steps in the front, seeing light light on it. The crowd rises and rises, it is a fake mountain. When wearing this fake cave, it was suddenly cheerful, and the sides were all strange flowers, which were very elegant. Everyone walked from the darkness to the bright place, and couldn&rsquo;t help but be dazzling. Although there are a lot of flowers and plants, they have no intention to linger when they are good and bad.
Everyone was waiting to walk forward, and suddenly listened to Haha and laughed at a strangely: &ldquo;The Qing Dynasty is not small!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crowd was frightened. When I watched it, it turned out to be a large hall in front. On the stone steps, a big monk seated his knees with a fierce appearance, a strong body, bare up his body, holding his feet with both feet, and a bunch of Rao Yan beside him. Two women standing next to each other, wearing a red cloak, about twenty years old, full of fat powder. Song Shi was busy calming down, and stepped forward and said, &ldquo;Master is above, the students are polite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The murderer ignored him and closed his eyes. In the Song Dynasty, he had to say again: &ldquo;I am a literati who are playing on the road. Master Mongolian Temple Temple takes me to the palace to follow the joy. When you go out, you will never mention the word of Gui Temple from the outsiders. I wonder how Master is? &quot;</p>
<p>The murderer and the two women closed their eyes, and they didn&rsquo;t say a word. Song Shi waited for a while and said again, the murderer still ignored it. The surname of Shi Shi is already impatient, so he said, &ldquo;The monk rests like this. As a monk, how can you set up a governor in the temple and hide women? I am a new noble person who is in Beijing. Let us go out, we will never start to the premise of people; if not, I will wait for the crime of governing your illegal crime. &quot;</p>
<p>Man thought that the murderer listened to this, and he would be afraid and let them go. Who wants the murderer and say, &ldquo;You wait for this group of shabby, you do n’t go in heaven, you do n’t have to go to hell. When I come to me, it is convenient for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone knew it. Seeing that the murderer is just one person, the two are the female streams, so everyone watched a look, ready to move forward and take the door out. When the murderer saw such a emotion, he laughed on his face, picked up the mercy next to him, and knocked only, and the crowd suddenly had his arms caught. At first glance, dozens of murderers from where they came from, some captured, some held sharp knives, and after a while, they had tied them to the ground. There were more than a dozen murderers who took more than a dozen stakes and tied him to the pile, and there were more than ten steps from the main hall. The great monk knocked Rao Yan twice, and the murderers retreated.  At this time, everyone was bold and fainted. However, Yun was slightly overthile, and he knew that it was here, so he had to wait. Suddenly I remembered that the parents and uncle in the family were all in the twilight years. Regret should not be a happy event, break into this scourge, and pay the expectations of relatives and friends on weekdays with the ambitions of his life. I couldn&rsquo;t help crying, crying, crying. Seeing that the murderer was sorrowful from this, he couldn&rsquo;t help laughing, and said to the two women next to him, &ldquo;You see them are poor, it is not worth it. I usually raise the talent status and do prestige at home. Blessings; once they are trapped and captured, there will be pustules like dolls who have lost their breasts. Why don&rsquo;t you go down to sing and dance, coax them? &quot;</p>
<p>The big red cloak turned backwards, revealing the white jade body, and had jumped into the hospital from the hospital. Powder, snow stocks, skin like grease. At the beginning of the leg, the square inch is vaguely visible. It turned out that these two women, except for a cloak, were naked. Compared with the dancers who were surrounded by the gauze under the umbilical umbilical, they had to open a lot. At this time, the murderer also brought Rao Ying&rsquo;s combos, and the two corridors walked out of a team of murderers who fastenly, and also came out to make fun. The sound of singing and dancing turned to the soul of more than ten people.  Everyone woke up and saw the wonderful look, and was suspected to be in a dream. Waiting for pulling your legs forward, looking carefully, but tightly tied by hemp ropes, unable to move. I remembered what was tied up and couldn&rsquo;t help but bold. Although the song and wonderful dance, Belle is currently appreciated. The hard work is the common sense of calling the world, painful to call the parents. At this life and death juncture, they are full of wealthy young and new, and many of their own dust cannot be left; and by the sound of crying from the cry, it evokes the feeling of everyone&rsquo;s life. One by one comes from it, not to break. At first, I was not touched by the scenery, weeping. Later, the more sad, the more sad, and crying one by one. I really watched my eyes and watched tears. The broken intestines met the broken intestines and mourned. The Zen Hall almost turned into a filial piety. Even the woman with the song and dance met such a poor situation. Although she was stunned by the murderer, she did not dare to stop.  That murderer is happy, and how can everyone be so beautiful and loud that the woman and the murderer of the music are all the same in the past, and they have returned to the quiet scene. The crowd suddenly started the thoughts of stealing, and they begged their lives one by one. The monk ignored himself, took a stack of stacks next to him, stood up, raised his hands, a yellow circle, and ran to the first wooden stake. This wooden pile was tied to the time of the Song Dynasty. When I saw that Huang Chengcheng flew like Huang Chengcheng in front of him, he was braided and fastened. He was tied to the pile and couldn&rsquo;t open his body. He knew that the big things were not good. Flying down. At that side, most of them were embedded in wood, and there was a sound. Seeing that the murderer suddenly stood up, and saw that he flew out a Huang Dongxi from his hands. He was suspected that the monk was the same as before, and there was any special thing to show them. When he saw Song Shi&rsquo;s head landing, he knew that the monk was playing this trick, and he wanted their lives and scared all the souls. Some are still asking, just in case; some are scared to faint. Speaking late, at that time, this murderer regarded everyone as the goal of testing. You see, the rabbits in the hall are rising, showing his skills. Suddenly, he turned over and flew out of the back; suddenly the meteor rushed to the moon, followed by a while. There is no deficiency, and the life of everyone is dead. After a while, the sixteen flying sides were embedded on the stakes, and the sixteen people also rolled a yard. Only Yun Zhi was one person, because the quantity was too small, the murderer&rsquo;s flying picked first played first, and he was lucky to extend his breath. Seeing that the murderer had been used, one person was still not dead, and he was going forward. Although the two women have experienced many strange things with the fierce monks for several years, they are the first to break the question. The woman&rsquo;s family was soft -hearted, and when she saw that the cloud was young, her face was like a girl, she couldn&rsquo;t help but move the thoughts, and said to the murderer: &ldquo;Master look at us, forgive this child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The murderer : &ldquo;Where do you know that capture of the tiger is easy to let go. He has more than ten people, and he dies in my hands. Only him is left, and he can&rsquo;t forgive him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two women still begged.  Yun must die from the point, and it was silent. Suddenly, when someone talked about his love for him, and then moved his hopes, he cried: &ldquo;My family is in Guiyang, and only one son in the nine houses. , Enlato my life. If I am afraid that I will leak secrets, please cut off my tongue and cut my fingers. I go back to write or say that I ca n’t say anything. My nine -bedroom cigarettes are full. I hope Master and two sisters will be grace. &quot;</p>
<p>It seemed unparalleled, and asked for a while. The murderer was also soft -kill because of the killing, and could not help but persuade the two beloved women, and said, &ldquo;This teacher reads you hard and seeks to see the two hearts of my heart, now let you live for three days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman went to call the guest, and took the three codes. The woman promised and walked. After a while, Zhike had taken a red disk, and there were three things on it: a small red paper bag; a rope, a pile of plates, and a knot; there was also a steel knife. Yun Cong didn&rsquo;t know what was useful. Only after three days, he still couldn&rsquo;t help but die. The murderer ignored him, so he was right: &ldquo;You put this doll in the stone prison, delivered the three -plate codes to him, and gave him a dozen hobs to let him live for three days. If you are willing to do the whole body, do it yourself. On the morning of the fourth day, if you go in jail, if he does not die, he will use this steel knife to take him back to his first level. &quot;</p>
<p>After a promise, he walked to the wooden stake, then Unlock the cloud from binding.  Yun was numb for half a day, and his body was numb. After some panic, the mental distress was extremely poor, and the rope just resolved was fainted to the ground. One: &ldquo;How good you are to be blessing at home at home, why do you have a good way to find a dead way at home? You can&rsquo;t escape, this teacher is compassionate to you, and you won&rsquo;t give you up. You will come with this teacher. &quot;</p>
<p>From this time, it was sore that he couldn&rsquo;t move, but he didn&rsquo;t dare to leave. Well -helpless, stood up, barely walked through the hall, walked through the two -story courtyard, and saw another hall. There was a stone wall next to the hall, about three feet high. When I saw a stone in front of the stone wall, I saw that the stone wall moved slowly, and a cave appeared. Yun Cong knew that the place was buried. He couldn&rsquo;t help but kneeling, begging hard, and crying his family condition, he cried, and asked for a rescue. When he saw him pitiful, he also moved his thoughts and said, &ldquo;When you first entered the temple, I talked with you very speculative. I can&rsquo;t do the Lord. Besides, my master&rsquo;s temple rules are very strict and don&rsquo;t feel like a face. I really love it. But I finally have a fate. I can do it except for you. . Hurry up and go, go into jail. &quot;</p>
<p>From knowing what he said, he knew that his vitality was absolute, so he begged him in these three days. Don&rsquo;t break the diet to make himself a deadly ghost. A promised. Then he would like to meet the three codes and clouds, and said to him, &ldquo;This small bag is poison. If you want to die fast, this will not be better. I will ask someone to send you three days of diet with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then After that, the cloud was pushed into the stone cave and turned around.
From the glance from Shidong, Yun was full of gloomy caves.</p>
<p>At this time, the stone wall outside was closed, and there was no light inside.</p>
<p>He has a wealthy home, where has he suffered so much.</p>
<p>At this time, the tragedy of the soreness was like the current death.</p>
<p>I remembered that my life could only last for three days.</p>
<p>The twilight parents and uncle, the nine -bedroom cigarettes rely on themselves to continue, seeing that I was miserable in a unclear body and became more sad.</p>
<p>At this time, some people had sent his three -day diet.</p>
<p>A large gourd water was the same as the first plate, and the dark exploration was explored.</p>
<p>There were about a few bowls of dishes.</p>
<p>This was originally a good intention.</p>
<p>Yun Cong was unintentional, but just cried.</p>
<p>You are crying and exhausted.</p>
<p>Here is a place where you should not be every day.</p>
<p>Yun entered the temple from breakfast.</p>
<p>After suffering many hardships, after crying for a long time, he was so sleepy that he was very sleepy.</p>
<p>When I woke up, I slept under the cold stone wall, cold, hungry and sad.</p>
<p>After taking the buns at hand, I ate two.</p>
<p>I remembered the danger of my parents and uncle in front of the family.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help crying again.</p>
<p>Seems to be tired and sleeping, waking up and crying, and sometimes I entered some diet.</p>
<p>The cave is dark, does not distinguish the day and night, and does not know after a few days.</p>
<p>In fact, the cloud was confused, and it was just the first night.</p>
<p>Anyone can practice my eyes best in the darkness.</p>
<p>Yun has been trapped in the cave for a day and night, and he can see something.</p>
<p>When I was crying, I suddenly saw that there was one thing beside me to lighten up and took it.</p>
<p>It turned out that it was a steel knife in the three codes of the monk.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t help but think of life in the evening, getting more sad and crying.</p>
<p>When he was sad, a breeze suddenly blowing, and a few rains floated on his face.</p>
<p>From the time of the madness, Yun was blown by the cool wind and drizzle, and he was sober a lot when he was in his mind.</p>
<p>This stone cave does not see the sky.</p>
<p>Where can the rain point come in?</p>
<p>Doubt in my heart.</p>
<p>Suddenly a flash of light flashed, and the stone cave was bright.</p>
<p>Then there was a rumbling voice.</p>
<p>Looking up, I saw a large round hole on the top of the stone cave.</p>
<p>When I entered the hole at first, because I was disturbed, the darkness was abnormal in the cave, so I never noticed it.</p>
<p>Now it is about rain and lightning outside.</p>
<p>I have to find that I can&rsquo;t help but move the thought of escape.</p>
<p>At that time, I stood up and groped around, knowing that the stone caves were piled on all sides of the masonry.</p>
<p>Although there is a small hole on the top, it is too high to leave the ground.</p>
<p>There is only a rope and a steel knife beside you.</p>
<p>There is no other equipment to apply.</p>
<p>Knowing that the crisis is urgent, urgent, quickly calm down, explain the sorrow, and think about the road to escape.</p>
<p>Later, he decided to escape from the hole on the top, and he tied the rope in the middle of the steel knife.</p>
<p>If he wanted to throw it up, hang it on the entrance of the hole, he could climb up.</p>
<p>Whoever wants to spend for a long time is still unable to do so.</p>
<p>It turned out that the cave was more than three feet from the ground, and the rope was only two feet long.</p>
<p>Slowly, he couldn&rsquo;t throw it up.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he hung up, and he couldn&rsquo;t go up to the rope.</p>
<p>A raw road, another bubble.</p>
<p>After being disappointed, he cried again.</p>
<p>In the end, he was unwilling to die, thinking for a long time, and he came up with a dumbfounder.</p>
<p>He walked under the walls on all sides, and used a knife to dial the brick, which happened to move.</p>
<p>He spent a lot of strength, just took these two bricks, and he was happy.</p>
<p>I wanted to open this hole and went out, and quickly dug it with a knife.</p>
<p>Suddenly, when I touched it with my hands, I couldn&rsquo;t help crying.</p>
<p>In the middle of the brick wall, there was a layer of iron plate.</p>
<p>Knowing that it is invalid and anxious.</p>
<p>I was a little hungry in my belly.</p>
<p>When I returned to the original place to pick up food, I was tripped by the rope under my feet.</p>
<p>Although he was a weak scholar, at this moment of life and death, he couldn&rsquo;t care about many hard work.</p>
<p>He holds a steel knife in his hand and still reaches the four walls.</p>
<p>From the broken brick seam, he uses a knife to dial those bricks.</p>
<p>At this time, the thunderous rain point was getting bigger and bigger, as if he saw the pity, and he deliberately helped him succeed.</p>
<p>In the end, he has limited strength, and the wall tiles are very solid, and the power of life is exhausting, so you can only set up 4050 pieces, four or five inches thick, and the ruler is more widely customized.</p>
<p>Essence With a pair of tender hands, Wu&rsquo;s blade was cut through several places.</p>
<p>He felt wet, and thought he thought he was sweating too hard.</p>
<p>Later, he slowly felt a little pain, only to know that it was injured.</p>
<p>Since his birth, he has been loved by his family since his birth.</p>
<p>At first, I did n’t find it, but it ’s it; after discovering, I gradually felt pain and difficulty, and my two feet were sour and numb.</p>
<p>I could n’t help but sit on the pile of masonry and cry.</p>
<p>After crying for a while, my eyes were drowsy.</p>
<p>When he was about to lie down, there seemed to be someone alert him by his ears: &ldquo;You are going to die now, and you are trying to work hard. Your parents&rsquo; cigarettes are continued, and the blood and harsh revenge of friends are all responsible. You are alone! &quot;</p>
<p>He suddenly realized that he suddenly woke up, knowing that now the rigidity is not as coquettish in front of the parents at home, and there are relatives to soothe. Not only is it crying and no one, but there is less time, and there will be less at a glance. Another thought of the tragic situation of death in the same year, and could not help but be frightened. Immediately drumming the courage, stood up, and endured the pain. He still tried his best to switch the bricks on the wall. This time has experience, which is easier than when he started. Each of the thirty or forty pieces is placed in the middle of the stone cave, like a paddy pagoda, piled up layer by layer. Running back and forth, he kept working with his hands and feet, and did not know how much time he passed, and he was piled up with a brick stack of seven or eight feet high. He estimates that the third night tonight, the time can no longer be slow. The calculation is standing on this masonry stack. The rope can be enough to stop the work. I drank two sips of water and a few sips of steamed buns. The blade was rolled up by him. He tied the rope in the middle of the knife, stabilized the steps, and slowly climbed up to the top of the top according to the original stacking steps. The area of ​​less than tolerate is enough. Because in the darkness, the pile was not stable, and the brick was crumbling and surprised him. Knowing that one does not pay attention to collapse, he never spares no effort to pile up. I had to stabilize my footsteps first, stood on top, dance up the rope, and wait for the lightning to see the holes on the quasi -head, throw it up and hang, and then climb out. Poor he condensed, quietly waiting for opportunities, several times when he was lightning, he was missed by the opportunity. The knife was on the rope, and he danced more and more rounded, and his energy became bigger and bigger. Sour sore, but dare not stop, afraid of being excited by the knife, hurting himself. You have to take care of the lightning on the top, and the knife dancing on his hand, and he is afraid of the collapse of the brick stack. He really cares about it. Suddenly a while of dizzy, a big shot, with a knife with a rope, and flew off. He was shocked, and he was unstable and slipped down from the brick stack. In the next four touch, the rope knife did not know where to go. After spending the hard work in the middle of the night, it became a bubble, and there was no effort to continue to struggle. Except for the death, there was no other idea. The elder brother wanted to get more sad, and he couldn&rsquo;t help crying again.  On the occasion of helplessness, the round hole in the top of the top suddenly passed, as if to see a long rope, swinging there. He quickly stopped his grief, looked closely, and couldn&rsquo;t help but flickered. When the electric light passed, it was clear that a rope was hung there, swaying with the wind, and it was very real. It turned out that when he danced just now, he took off his hand and slipped to the top. He just hung it at the entrance of the cave. He thought that he would unintentionally unintentionally become him. In the darkness, it is very happy to encounter a line of vitality. It is very happy. He took a spirit, climbed to the brick stack, and pushed it with his hand. And the brick was thick and large. When he slipped down, he only slid down the top four or five pieces. The rest was not hindered. After some horror, more and more careful. He groped around with his hands and feet, and then tried to climb up. Turn off where you slide again. Slowly climbing to the top, stood up and stood up. When it is hard on my head, it happens that there is another lightning, and it is estimated that it is not allowed to leave the head. He calmed down and waited for the second lightning to light up. At this moment, he climbed his head and climbed his head. Suddenly, the body fell on the brick again, and it was frightened again. And the joy is only one or two feet, and it will not move. Try it hard, knowing that the karma has been hung in the gap and is very strong. This time is enough for the size. There is no need to wait for lightning anymore. The escape is tight. He also forgot the knife injury and pain on his hand. Two hands helping the rope to climb up. Although he would not have martial arts, he was young and light in the end, and he was enough. He used his left elbow to hold the hole in his left elbow, and put his body together hard. He was exhausted and couldn&rsquo;t move. The electric flashes on the top of the electricity, getting bigger and bigger, pouring him all over and down. After a while, I was sober by the cool rain again. Thinking of the holes now, it is still in Longtan of the tiger hole. This hole is very high from the ground, and the fracture is broken. I had to talk about the lightning light, and let&rsquo;s talk about the direction of clearing.  The east side of this hole is the way to come the day before, the west is against the large hall, and the temple intercons in the south. However, the north is against the wall, and I think it was the next door, so I decided to escape from the north. At this time, the rain was getting bigger and bigger. The rainwater on the branches, the waterfall generally slipped down. Yun has been unstable, slipped several times, and almost fell down. Add the high tall in the cave, and the side is tilted, and you have to add a careful point. You have to wait for the light to flash in order to climb forward. It is easy to go to the north to lean on the wall, and you can&rsquo;t help crying. It turned out that this hole was still three or four feet away from the wall. He couldn&rsquo;t have martial arts, and how could he dare to jump on the wall in the night of the wind and rain? Even if the adventure jumped to the wall, I don&rsquo;t know how high the wall is from the ground. Isn&rsquo;t it broken?
There was nothing to do, and suddenly there was a strong wind passing, and there seemed to be something floating on his face.</p>
<p>He was busy catching with his hands.</p>
<p>The elasticity of that thing was very great, and he almost took him down and scared him.</p>
<p>I felt that I was holding something in my hand and calming my mind.</p>
<p>With a lightning light, it turned out to be a few yellow crooked leaves.</p>
<p>I wanted to be the big tree of the partition wall.</p>
<p>When I was thinking, there was another thunder, followed by a big lightning.</p>
<p>When looking forward, a big yellow barrel tree was swayed in the wind and rain.</p>
<p>A horizontal branch, extending to the wall, the branch ends have been broken.</p>
<p>I thought it was scratched by the wind and was climbed by myself.</p>
<p>I was waiting to see that the electric light had passed, and it was still dark.</p>
<p>I thought: &ldquo;If you have a gust of wind just now, and then blow the branches over, you can climb the branches and climb the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time Seeing that the tree was blown up and crooked by the wind, there were several times that the branches had blown away. In the end, the timid and dare not take risks to catch. Wait until the opportunity is over, and regret it. Finally, he had the courage, clenched his teeth, stood up, and made a momentum that was pushing forward, ready to fight for an escape. It happened that the wind power came at the same time, and it was very coincident, and the branches were blowing in his hands. From then on, he took his body forward, and his two hands had just grasped the branches. Suddenly a big whirlwind, the branches flew the clouds from the top of the cave, and flew out of the wall out of thin air. At this time, he had closed the degree of life and death. At this moment, I felt that my feet seemed to be beaten heavy. Following a big thunderbolt around him, he was deafening. At the same time, he was shocked at the same time.  When I woke up, I slept on a wooden bed with the same old girl standing next to her, like father and daughter. Just listening to the woman said, &ldquo;Dad, he wakes up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he passed a bowl of warm water and drank it with Yun. Yun Cong remembered that he had escaped, knowing that he fell down from the tree, and he was rescued by the two of them. At that time, I took the bowl and took a sip, and I would get up and thank you. The old man said busy: &ldquo;Why do you here? Why did you fall down from the wall of the temple next door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yun Cong stayed with him and felt faintly painful. I thought it was injured by the wall when I crossed the wall just on the branch. of. I was tired overnight, and I was really tired. He was no longer polite, he still fell asleep, and said about it.</p>
