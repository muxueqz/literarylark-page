    <p>Forty -seventh time the giant Ma Xiong enables to pick Zhuguan orangutan  The monster lowered his head and looked at it again.</p>
<p>He reached the cave again, just like the child fishing the goldfish in the goldfish tank.</p>
<p>He saw his hand and slipped out of the hand.</p>
<p>The ground yelled, and the hair was getting worse.</p>
<p>In this crisis, Ying Qiong did not dare to neglect.</p>
<p>He came over between this stone cave hair and jumped over.</p>
<p>, Obstructing hands.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ying Qiong was on the right corner, and the monster&rsquo;s hair stretched out.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong just got up and was stuck in the middle of his legs.</p>
<p>There is only a ruler away from the side, a little delay, I am afraid that it will not be pinched as a pink.</p>
<p>It was still Ying Qiong was born with bravery.</p>
<p>She was in a hurry and was born with wisdom.</p>
<p>Seeing that Mao came, she poured her back and let the giant Maojia, holding his right hand on his right hand, a golden carp jumping the dragon door, flattened flat to an entrance of a stone seam.</p>
<p>Essence Surprisingly, the sword he had brought was wrong.</p>
<p>Thinking of it: &ldquo;The four zombies of this sword were not laborious at first, and it was scattered into a pile of bones in a moment. Go, when is it? I want to be frightened, I will forget this strange treasure. &quot;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help scolding myself to say&rdquo; sluggish insect &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Thinking of this place, the sword has been out of the box and was in his hand. That sword wanted to know that today&rsquo;s heroes are already useful, and the purple light emitted on it is clear. The big hair of the monster did not know that Ying Qiong hid in the stone cracks in the cave, and only traveled deep in the depths. After a while, I couldn&rsquo;t catch it, and I was in a hurry, and Ying Qiong had a good idea. The sword came out of the box. The monster seemed to have awareness. He just had to exit his hand out of the hole. Ying Qiong&rsquo;s sword light could not help Ying Qiong as the master, and he automatically rolled over. In Ziguangying, the big finger of the monster had been cut off by sword light two. The monster was hit hard, roaring, and the hairy hand retreated quickly. Ying Qiong saw the light of the cave. In this room, it was not allowed to go. I thought: &ldquo;This hole is disgusted and there is no way out. That monster is afraid of this sword. It is a big harm to this hundred -mile creature nearby. &quot;</p>
<p>Thinking of this, ambitions have risen, turning the idea of ​​being afraid of sorrow into black. Ying Qiongsheng is different and his mind is extremely keen. This kind of imagination is only a moment. The monster was originally squatted underground, stretched his hands into the cave to fish, and was chopped by Yingqiong Ziqi Sword. As soon as he stood up, Ying Qiong went out in the middle of his leg seam.  After speaking for a long time, the Chichengzi quoted Yingqiong to visit the teacher. Why did she throw her in Mang Cangshan Murder Temple halfway? In addition to Ying Qiong Delong, she finally fled into the stone cave and was knocked down by the white monster in white (the monster in white, the moonlight came on the stone, was misunderstood by Yingqiong&rsquo;s dazzling), and she couldn&rsquo;t help but hit her head on the stone Falling, mistakenly as a monster, there are four zombies in the murderer, and the purple sword of the god dragon hidden in the red drum is left? Why is this mountain so warm? In the future, Yingqiong went to Mangcang Mountain to steal Wen Yu, and Ma Xiong replied two times in Germany, and found that the Shi Ji left by the real people of Changmei was explained at that time. Do not make up for the origin of the giant from the readers.  Since ancient times, the mountains are in the mountains, and there are many dragon snakes; the ancient cave of the unmanned deep valleys often has many mountains and wooden guests. This giant is one of the mountains. The stone cave lying in Yingqiong is where it stores food. It caught the beast creatures in the mountains and was stored inside, and then closed with the three -foot stone screen of the cave entrance to prevent escape from escape. Ying Qiong was sleeping in the cave last night and was discovered by it this morning. It was because it was not hungry at the time, and the little girl fled before blocking the cave door with a stone. The stone screen is very heavy, more than 10,000 pounds. Slowly say Ying Qiong, no matter how powerful the beasts are, they want to push the slightest. It closed the cave&rsquo;s entrance, and Ying Qiong&rsquo;s purple sword was originally a god. Suddenly, he shouted a long box and woke Yingqiong from his dream. When Ying Qiong found that the cave door was blocked by the stone, the mountain industry had turned back. As usual, he lowered his head and looked at it, and then reached into the cave to fish. I didn&rsquo;t want to be cut off by Ying Qiong&rsquo;s Zi Sword. The anger was very angry, and the storm was like a thunder. He was pulled up a big tree with his left hand, trying to stuff it into the hole, and tapping the enemy. Ying Qiong had slipped out of his legs.  The monster looked down and looked at it with a lot of hair. After Ying Qiong came out, he first counted his body, and he had been away from the mountains of dozens of feet. Looking back, I saw that monster was born fierce and tall, and his head was only on its foot. Staring two green eyes, opened the blood basin&rsquo;s mouth, stretched out two large yellow hair hands, chasing over. Although Ying Qiong rely on the strength of the sword, she knew that the monster was tall and infinite. If she was not a key, she was caught a little, and she would be miserable. Therefore, I dare not make the time. Relying on the body of the body, I only picked the dense forest, and the forests were running around. Seeing Yingqiong jumped as flying, she couldn&rsquo;t touch it, causing sexuality like thunder, and chasing chasing, banging, shaking the mountains. Although Yingqiong was clever, she ran from early morning to this noon, and she was exhausted. At the end of the last time, the mountains seemed to be a little poor, and the pursuit gradually became slow. Ying Qiong was hiding behind a big tree, hiding in the dense leaves, and hiding in the dense leaves. The mountains seemed to have never seen it. She looked back towards Ying Qiong and looked around. Ying Qiong secretly liked the monster that he had never seen, and was trying to breathe for a moment. Who knows that the mountain is more cunning than her. The purple light on Yingqiong sword is a special mark. Seeing Yingqiong&rsquo;s vertical jumping, it is not easy to get. When Ying Qiong went to the tree, he deliberately faced Ying Qiong, pretending to look forward to look forward, but his body gradually retreated to Ying Qiong. Although this tree is tall, only the monster&rsquo;s neck. Ying Qiong was breathing, and saw that the monster retreated to the tree, but he reached out. Although he thought the monster did not see himself, he did not dare to neglect. It was going to be on the other trees. Who knew that the monster was closer to the tree, and he looked back, yelled, stretched out two hands with several feet long hands, and hugged the big tree. The tree was hugged by the mountain, and the branches stuck loudly, and they broke down. Yingqiong was standing on the branches of the three or four feet off the ground. When she was about to start up, she suddenly saw the monster rotating like a flying, and even took a tree with a tree. Essence In a hurry, a sister -in -law rolled over, slipped down, leaving the band of the ground, lifted his feet across his feet, padded with a tree, and pumped the snake to eat, and he cried out. The original preparation was on the other tree again. After half a day, one couldn&rsquo;t accept it, and the feet were just on the ground. They were seeing the strange property that had tightened the tree. Left hand was hiding in Yingqiong.  At first, Ying Qiong didn&rsquo;t want to use the sword to go to the monster. Because the hands of Naoshan were too long and the body was too tall. If it was to stab its fatal place, the sword had not arrived, and it was injured by both hands. Even if it was killed, it would be difficult for you to escape. It was also because of her purple sword. She did not know its wonderful use, and was also affected by Li Ningzhen&rsquo;s martial arts tips. It was influenced by me who was not enough to win, so I was tired for half a day. Essence At this time, when I saw the monster holding the tree tightly, I was looking for it, and I did not find that I was going to slip. It was a good chance to start. As soon as the feet were dipped in the ground, they padded hard, a swallow pierced the clouds, and raised her body with four or five feet high. go. Only when the hand was, the sword had turned into the long purple light of ten feet, and flew off, and even the mountain cricket and the big tree were only around. Ying Qiong was unable to make it in the air. He originally worked hard and made the strength of breastfeeding. Suddenly, the sword in his hand flew out of his hands out of thin air, and he doubted himself to make him too hard. He was surprised for a while. &ldquo;Ah&rdquo;</p>
<p>, a wind rolled with flowers, turning the tendon, just falling to the ground to find the way to escape, and the monster yelled at the monster, scaring Ying Qiong&rsquo;s heartbroken. Then there were a few loud noises in the bombardment. Zhen Ying Qiong was dazzling and dizzy, his heart shook his body, and he stood unstable when he landed on the ground. After a while, I had to wake up and feel that the smell of smell beside me, and there are several wet people on my body. They are suspected to be in the hands of the monster. In a hurry, the monster of Shi Cai has become two and a half, and died underground. The blood on the monster was like a mountain spring, and it flowed straight to the low -lying place.
Ying Qiong was lying in a pool of blood, knowing that the monster had been chopped by his purple sword, so unhappy.</p>
<p>He didn&rsquo;t have to be in pain all over his body, and he was thinking of standing to see what happened, and he heard the voice around him.</p>
<p>Looking back and looking out, there are five or six feet away from your side, with hundreds of thousands of Malaysian bears, except that the side of the monster dies, there is no other side.</p>
<p>One by one is a horse -headed bear body, long hair, large body, and fierce state.</p>
<p>There was a unicorn on his head, his back was slightly flexed, his front feet were double -arched, kneeling there, staring at a pair of red eyes, looking at Ying Qiong, not moving.</p>
<p>This kind of horse bear was born with the female bear.</p>
<p>The head is unicorn, the scales are all over the body, the roar is like a drum, the most violent sex, can eat tiger and leopard.</p>
<p>That bear is also a strong beast in the mountains.</p>
<p>These two powerful beasts cooperated with horse bears, and they were fierce.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong has been used to raising from a young age.</p>
<p>She has seen such powerful and fierce things, and there are too many.</p>
<p>Three sides are surrounded, and you can escape.</p>
<p>Besides, after half a day, the karma was exhausted and sore.</p>
<p>I took a sip of the sword and flew off again, and it was too late to find it.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh: &ldquo;I will rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I wanted to hit the rocks to death, so as not to be miserable by those beasts during my lifetime. As soon as he stood up, the two -legged soreness was so soft that he was not called by himself. Looking at the horse bear who was around, he didn&rsquo;t move. Seeing Ying Qiong sit down, he closed his front paws and arched towards Ying Qiong again and again.  Ying Qiong secretly looked around, all of which were so arched, so strange. Suddenly, when I moved, I said, &ldquo;My Li Yingqiong Mengxian gave me a purple sword, dedicated to the world to remove the monsters. The big monster was beheaded by me. Dare to surround me, is it not good for bullying the sword in my box? &quot;</p>
<p>Speaking of this place, I touched it without any heart, and suddenly felt that I touched my hoe with my hand. I thought, &ldquo;Is it scared just now, and the sword hasn&rsquo;t been off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although I thought so, I didn&rsquo;t dare to see it suddenly. Later, the more I touched it, and I took the horn handle gently, with a loud sound, the sword came out of the box, and the purple light was still the sword. He was happy in his heart and stood up immediately. I was not in time to count on why the sword was still in the box, and I barely stood up, and pointed at the group of horse bears in the sword facing the sword, and drank: &ldquo;Wait for this group of evil beasts, retreat quickly! Otherwise, I will fly, and want to live! Sure enough, those horse bears were very afraid of this sword, and the sword came out of the box, so she retreated more than ten feet. But still did not go away, one by one kneeling on the ground, the forefoot arch could not hold it. Ying Qiong is becoming more strange, I don&rsquo;t know what the intention of this beast is. Look at them, not like hurting people. Then he asked, &quot;</p>
<p>I just kneeling towards me, unlike to violate my spirit, is it asking for me?&rdquo; Those horse bears listened, and they really tied their heads, and fingered the front paws to Ying Qiong behind. Ying Qiong turned back and thought of the piles of beast bones I saw in the hole last night. He asked again, &quot;</p>
<p>I waited for me to go to the big monster for you, and I was grateful in my heart, so I kneeling towards me, right?&rdquo; The group of horse bears worshiped again and again. There are two largest ones inside, and they took a few steps in front of Yingqiong. Seeing Yingqiong&rsquo;s movement, I moved forward, and gradually separated only three or five feet away. Alas.  Yingqiong estimates that the two Malaysian bears must be the leaders of these horse bears. Looking at their spirit, they are very afraid of the sword, so they will return the sword to them; &quot;</p>
<p>I was inadvertently did not care, and other harm. Although you are grateful, why not be? Now the monster has been removed, even more useless, do you not go, when will you wait? &ldquo;The two Malaysian bears shook their heads and turned back to the back. From the mouth made a sound like a drum. There are a dozen slightly larger stables, such as Fei walking around Yingqiong. After a while, the drums were shocked, and those horse bears that were lying on both sides of Yingqiong suddenly chaotic and ran away. They fled behind Ying Qiong and kneeled behind, each finging the front paws towards the opposite side. Ying Qiong returned to the death of the big monster. The dust across the other side was flying, and there were more than a dozen Malaysian bears on the hillside, and there was a drum sound in her mouth, like flying to Ying Qiongli&rsquo;s escape. There are dozens of feet behind, a giant, which is generally the same as the dead monster who is dead. He shouted the same as the dead monster and took a big step, like flying chasing. Yingqiong understood the intention of Ma Xiong. Because I was tired of my energy, I didn&rsquo;t dare to come forward to welcome the enemy easily. I was busy hiding the body behind a big stone, took out the sword and acted.  Nasama was a male and a female, living in a cave. This mountain horse bear is the most, which is the special food of Nashan. Today, Xiongshan came out to find food. The female was impatient. Suddenly, the roar of the horse bears outside the cave was different from the past. A horse bear ran slightly slowly. He was caught up by the mountain. He grabbed the neck skin, opened the blood basin, bitten the neck, and threw it on the ground. Ying Qiong saw this mountain so fierce, was particularly shocked, and was lucky to replace himself. After a while, the mountain puppet chased the mountain here, and at a glance, I saw the corpse of Xiongshan, and put down the horse bear and did not chase. Fist -like size, the expression is very funny. The Youshan Tao Tao for a while, and looked at Nobu&rsquo;s wound again, as if to study how to die. After thinking about it for a while, suddenly suddenly became angry, and the big trees close to it were fluttered by the sky. Na Shan was called there, and he accidentally looked back. He saw the purple light from Ying Qiong&rsquo;s body, and saw that Ying Qiong hid himself, so he fell back, like Fei rushing towards Ying Qiong.  When Ying Qiong was seeing God, she suddenly felt a dark eyes, and the female puppet fluttered like flying, and suddenly panicked. Knowing the monster&rsquo;s hand is long, if the sword is stabbing, the sword has not yet arrived, and it has been hurt by its hand. In the urgent student, he had no choice but to do so, while the monster had not yet arrived, he threw the purple sword in his hand towards the monster&rsquo;s neck. He struggled to work hard and went out of the barrier. When I was waiting for it again, I saw the ten long purple lights passing by, around the monster&rsquo;s neck, and a big head of a water tank cut down. At the same time, the corpse of about ten feet, connected the big head, fluttered twice, fell empty to dust. Where nearby, the trees were broken and the dust fluttered. It was quiet when there was a tea. The purple sword was gone, and Changhong -like purple light was circled in the air, and she automatically returned to Ying Qiong&rsquo;s sword box next to Ying Qiong, which scared Yingqiong. I didn&rsquo;t expect that the sword was so different, I was happy in my heart, holding the sword box, and thanks to the more than grateful.  Those stables saw the monsters who were stunned by Ying Qiong, and they jumped one by one, walking towards the two dead mountains, as if they were still a little afraid, and dare not approach suddenly. In the end, the two big ones first grabbed the front claws with the front paws, and did not see the movement, and yelled. This thousands of horse bears stepped forward together, and they were handled all around, biting and grabbing, and for a while, there were only a pile of yellow bones left to dismantle the ground. Ying Qiong was looking up, and suddenly he felt hungry in his belly, and walked towards the cave before. Fortunately, the food and food of clothes were not damaged, but the family biography that was brought out by the home had been folded into two sections by the monster. Quickly changed the blood in the dark part of the cave, walked out of the cave and looked at it. The group of horse bears were far away from the cave gate, kneeling into a circle, and stopping Yingqiong to the road. Ying Qiong was holding a yellow essence in one hand and was eating. He said according to the sword: &quot;</p>
<p>Earth and other revenge have been reported. Why not let me go on the road, is it possible to report their hatred?&rdquo; The big two facing Ying Qiong compared with the front paws and compared with the front paws. That meaning, it seemed that Ying Qiong did not eat Huang Jing in his hand, and then sent out the previous drum sound from his mouth. There are more than a dozen horse bears walking around. Two other stables walked to a tree, holding a shook with a shook, uprooted, and the claws were applied together, and the branches were folded. A horse bear raised his head, stood up, and lifted to the cave. Another one rode up, took a few steps, put down again, and pointed at Ying Qiong. Yingqiong estimated that it was asked to ride it, and they were lifted away. Although they knew that there were no maliciousness. In case of these beasts, how can it be good? I don&rsquo;t know where they are raising themselves. Seeing that the Japanese color is not early, the weather is still early, and they are exhausted. They get them for a while, which is also interesting. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>I have to have this sword, and call the police several times in advance. Two sounds; if you can&rsquo;t go, you will make a long sound. I have a good idea. &ldquo;The words were still, and the sword really stunned. Ying Qiong was happy in his heart, and approached the horse bear in front of him, sitting down the tree and sitting down.
The group of Ma Xiong saw Ying Qiong to let them carry them away, and one by one jumping to arch, it seemed very happy.</p>
<p>The two big bears, one in front of them, and one behind, the drums in their mouths sounded, and the thousands of horses bears were back and forth, like lining up, lifted Yingqiong, and walked straight down the mountain, walking very quickly.</p>
<p>After several mountains, there were several mountains, and it went up a mountain peak.</p>
<p>The peaks were all strange flowers.</p>
<p>It was not far from the mountain.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of horse bears arranged on the roadside, one by one kneeling on the ground, and people standing.</p>
<p>Ten steps forward, see a big cave far from a distance.</p>
<p>Leaded by a dozen stables, followed a large group of orangutan, each orangutan held many unknown mountain fruit in both hands, and Fei ran beside Yingqiong, and presented the fruits held in his hands.</p>
<p>Yingqiong took a few food at will, and she carried her forward from the two horse bears that lifted the tree.</p>
<p>After a while, when I walked to the cave, this cave was tall and abnormal.</p>
<p>The group of horse bears and orangutans lifted Yingqiong into the hole and put down the tree.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong came down and looked around.</p>
<p>This hole was actually anomalous, about a hundred feet wide.</p>
<p>Among them, a boulder about two feet high and about ten feet wide was covered with many animal skin.</p>
<p>The two orangutans will go up, and the scholars are sitting and lying.</p>
<p>The jumping will be pulled down again, pulling the sleeves of Jiao Yingqiong, and can&rsquo;t stop in his mouth.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong understood what it meant, and sat down and sat down.</p>
<p>Looking below, the thousands of horse bears, connected to many orangutan, were divided into ten rows from outside the cave and kneeling.</p>
<p>More than a dozen orangutans replaced the fruit.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong was eating at will.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there was an unknown mountain fruit in the fruit.</p>
<p>The blood was red and the size of a longan was.</p>
<p>Bai Kenzi is very bright.</p>
<p>Eat in his mouth, Gan Fang was full of cheeks.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are not many, there are only a dozen of them.</p>
<p>After eating it, I feel refreshing and long, and the fatigue of the first time is swept away.</p>
<p>Knowing that it is Qizhen in the mountains, he took the peel in his hands and said to the orangutan who was eaten, &ldquo;This fruit is very good, maybe you can pick me up to take it away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning around and shouted towards those companions. At the moment, there were a dozen orangutans walking out of the hole. After walking straight for more than half an hour, they returned five or six, and only one Zhu Guo was present in each hand. The orangutan who made a decree was sorrowful a few times. The orangutans in the whole hole are sorrowful.  Yingqiong didn&rsquo;t know what they wanted. Just because of greed for these horse bears and orangutans, they were very unsatisfactory, and waited for the orangutan to pick Zhuguo, which delayed a lot of time. The cave was very bright until the day outside was flat, and I didn&rsquo;t know that the door was facing the West. Ying Qiong was here to command the beasts. When he was happy, he suddenly saw a round of red day outside the cave. There were a lot of acres. I knew that the sky was too early, I couldn&rsquo;t go on the road, I couldn&rsquo;t help but panic. Looking out of the cave, it is still bright as day, reflecting the sunset, and the endless color. I want to stay here for a while, and go again tomorrow morning. However, a young girl is in the deserted mountains where this person can&rsquo;t get, and the same place with these tiger and leopards. After thinking down for a while, he said to those horse bears and orangutan: &ldquo;Today is dark, I can no longer be on the road, and I want to stay over a night in your waiting hole. , So as not to come out of the sword in my box, and hurt my life by mistake. &quot;</p>
<p>Then, this thousand horses and those orangutan roared a few times, and all of them exited the cave, leaving only one gorilla in the cave, leaving only one gorilla in the cave, leaving only one gorilla to be in the cave. The cave was standing.  Seeing that these beasts can pass through, they are very happy. Because time is still early, I plan to sleep for a while. Then he jumped off the big stone and walked out of the cave. Seeing the full mountains and the wild, all the horse bears inhabited. Only the more than a hundred orangutan gathered under a cliff corner, lingering, and crying. Although Ying Qiong does not know the beast, it seems to be discussing something. There was an old orangutan in the inside, which was the leader of the talented commander. He was standing there and pointed at his mouth. Suddenly he turned around, and when Ying Qiong came, he screamed. The orangutan returned together, kneeling on the ground, and scratching his head towards Ying Qiong. The old orangutan approached Ying Qiong and kneeling down and pulled up La Yingqiong&rsquo;s sleeves. Ying Qiong approached the orangutan group with it. It turned out that five dead orangutan corpses were lying underground. The orangutan pointed at the dead orangutan&rsquo;s head with his front palm. When Ying Qiong leaned over, the five orangutan was a general way of death: a large hole on his head, the orangutan&rsquo;s brain was empty, and it seemed like something was caught. One of the inside, and a Zhu Guo was pinched tightly. Remember: &ldquo;The red is greedy for the red, and I used a dozen orangutan to find it again. Later, I only returned half of it, and there were not many red fruits recovered. Because of the near dusk, I originally planned to be called orangutan tomorrow morning. Looking for the way, I never put it on my heart. Looking at these orangutan, I want to die for red fruit. For myself for a moment, I have hurt a few lives, which is so sad. And these orangutans are the same. , It is by no means because of the misfortune of the cliff, there must be any monster and strange beasts in this mountain. Trying the orangutan is good at talking, but the orangutan can pass through this place. Ask these orangutan. If there are beasts who eat orangutan, I will remove them with the swords next to me. It seems that it is injured by what monster is because of picking up that red fruit. Why don&rsquo;t you get me, how do you get rid of you? &quot;</p>
<p>Before the words, these orangutans told all the time. Ying Qiong saw Haoyue Zhengming, Qing Guang was like day, and his sword was a god that could be sent and could be sent. The old orangutan shook his head and pointed at the moon with his forefoot. Ying Qiong estimated that it was inconvenient to go at night, so he asked, &ldquo;What do you mean is that the monster at night is not easy to find? Then how about I will go tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orangutan nodded and cheered and jumped for a while. There were more than a dozen orangutan, and the dead body of the dead orangutan was lifted behind the mountain.  Ying Qiong looked at the moonlight for a while, and returned to the cave to see it. It was still bright in the hole, just like daytime, very amazing, and suspected that there was a strange treasure. After looking for more than an hour, I didn&rsquo;t find it. I had to stop it, and I had a stable sleep at night. The climate in the cave is as warm as early summer. Sleep until the red day is rising, and there are no other abnormalities. Wait until you wake up, sit on the stone. The orangutan next to the cave saw Ying Qiong got up, a long howl, and immediately shocked the drums. The orangutan and horse bears outside the cave would come in like a tide. Ying Qiong was almost startled. These horse bears are still louting, and the hundred and ten orangutan blooms.  Ying Qiong took a closer look at it, and did not think of the kind of red yesterday. He only remembered to promise those orangutans to remove them today. After eating a meal, I ran outside the cave first, looking for the secluded place, which was convenient for a while. He entered the hole again, stood on the stone and said, &ldquo;I will get up today. I waited to pick the red fruit yesterday, and there were five similar victims. It can quickly lead me to remove it, so as not to harm the spirit after leaving. &quot;</p>
<p>The words were over, and the orangutan and Ma Xiong each became one after another. Ying Qiong wrapped the package, wrapped the remaining chocolate with many delicious fruit, and went down to the ground. The horse bears immediately gave up a road. The old orangutan stood up, Chao Yingqiong twice, and led the way in front. The two sides were about Xu Yuan and near, and the old orangutan walked all the way and looked back from time to time.  In front of the orangutan, the horse bears were behind, and they all bowed their heads and walked slowly, without making some sounds. In this lonely deep mountain, only the sound of the foot was listened to the ground, and the dust was flying. Yingqiong passed the hill with the old orangutan, and those horse and bear stopped, and only led Ying Qiong to a cliff from the old orangutan. Suddenly, a lonely peak protruded a hundred feet high, and there were many unknown strange flowers on the hills. There is a very long and deep puppet below the peak, flowing water, and spring sounds. Ying Qiongzheng felt that the scenery here was beautiful, and the gorgeon who was walking in front suddenly stopped, and it was very afraid of it. As soon as Ying Qiong talked, the gorilla suddenly fingered with a hole beside the front paw. Ying Qiong looked at the hole with six or seven feet, black, and it seemed very deep. There is a weird big stone next to the hole. There is a small tree that is height and red like corals on the stone. Essence
Ying Qiong is strange that the tree has never been seen before.</p>
<p>How can I grow on the stone?</p>
<p>Listening to the ears suddenly.</p>
<p>Looking back at the old orangutan, there has always been a hundred feet far away.</p>
<p>I thought, &ldquo;Is this place where monsters are hidden?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a while, without seeing the movement, I wanted to pick up Zhu Guo on the stone. As soon as I stepped, the sound beside my ears suddenly, the sword in the box stunned, leap in succession. I knew that there was a different ingredient, I couldn&rsquo;t help but be surprised. When I looked at that hole, I saw two lights flashing. In a moment, when he whispered, a monster -like monster -like monster, with a yellow fur with yellow fur, five or six feet long, but his arms were longer than the monster body. Both hands are like bird&rsquo;s claws, thin and long. Wearing a blond hair. Two green eyes are as big as copper bells. Looking up at it, he jumped up than the arrow, yelled like a wolf, stretched out two bird&rsquo;s claws, and raised it with three or five feet high. Unusual, illness like lightning. Seeing that the monster was too fast to see the monster was too fast, she couldn&rsquo;t resist, and she was busy leaning her body to two feet away. The monster grabbed an empty, and was grabbing the stone on Yingqiong Station, and the claws flew everywhere. He roared and rushed to Yingqiong again. At this time, Ying Qiong had pulled his sword in his hand, and when he got out of the box, there was a purple light shining on the sun. The monster seemed to know that the sword was powerful, and Qiao Yingqiong stopped it in the heart. He couldn&rsquo;t return to the acupuncture point. He had to turn back and flee to Yingqiong Lai Road. Ying Qiong hurriedly chased afterwards. When she was about to let go of the sword in her hand, she blinked and only heard the sound of many gorilla crying bears. The monster had flying in the wind and disappeared.  Another time, the old orangutan led many kinds of similar types, and he screamed all the way, met Ying Qiong, and worshiped. Seeing that among the oranges, there are many orangutans with broken arm folding stocks and broken brain. When the monster escaped, Lu Yu&rsquo;s hiding dodge group was sexually ordered, so there were a few orangutan injuries. When Ying Qiong saw the monster escape, he regretted that he had never started in advance. She Da Mang Cangshan, where to find the monster, want to wait for the sleeves to go, and pity these orangutan life. The old orangutan wanted to be afraid of Yingqiong, kneeling on the ground, and pulling Yingqiong&rsquo;s sleeves. The injured orangutan was more sorrowful. I couldn&rsquo;t help but evoke Ying Qiongxia&rsquo;s courage, and said to the old orangutan: &ldquo;Although I am like an arrow, I am unfortunately fled by the monster while the monster. After ten days, if you ca n’t find it, that is, that ’s the destruction of the monster, I ca n’t stay for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
