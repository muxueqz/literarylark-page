    <h1>Fifty -eighth time, light and anger with plum blossoms, wisdom and fairy roots to find blue strokes</h1>
    <p>Fifty -eighth time, light and anger with plum blossoms, wisdom and fairy roots to find blue strokes  Ruo Lan thought about the situation of the two people who had a mix of venison and mixed with the mouth, guess that Jin Chan and Zhu Wen were accompanied by salute.</p>
<p>After turning his body to the cliff, he listened to Zhu Wen&rsquo;s laughter and was busy covering him.</p>
<p>Just listening to Zhu Wen laughed: &ldquo;Damn! The flowers have not been collected, and I sprinkled my petals. On the other side, I want the horizontal branch obliquely out of that northwest corner. Who wants to be so big, get it back, get it back, Do you go to Chaihe? &quot;</p>
<p>Ruo Lan smelled a fragrance and looked forward to seeing. It turned out that a large plum tree was born on the side of the cliff, which was very lush. Zhu Wen stood locally that Jin Chan and orangutan were based on plum branches. After a while, Jin Chan took the small horizontal branches that Zhu Wen wanted, but the orangutan picked a big branch of five or six feet long. After the golden cicada and orangutan went down, they handed the plum blossoms with Zhu Wen. Zhu Wen looked at Jin Chan with a good look at him: &ldquo;You have collected it, I don&rsquo;t want you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, after taking the long plum in the hands of the orangutan, he walked around and walked around. The orangutan was very naughty, and he also learned from people&rsquo;s words. He said to Jin Chan: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jin Chan was angry, and stepped forward to fight. The orangutan was so scared that he jumped down the cliff and had no trace. Jin Chan talked to Zhu Sen: &ldquo;Are you still angry with me? Next time I don&rsquo;t have a strong lips with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhu Wen stood there, but ignored it. Jin Chan still couldn&rsquo;t help saying good words, and asked Zhu Wen to pick up the plum blossom he picked. Zhu Wen couldn&rsquo;t be entangled by him, and was about to reach out. Ruo Lan couldn&rsquo;t help laughing. He quickly resisted and said loudly, &ldquo;The sky is not too early, you still pick plum blossoms. What about the cliff. &quot;</p>
<p>Zhu Wen saw Ruolan suddenly appeared, and he couldn&rsquo;t help his face red. Jin Chan couldn&rsquo;t, and had to follow Ruolan. As soon as I walked into the entrance, everyone was there, the god carving industry had flew back, and the British men did not pick up. Ying Qiong was holding a white half -arm in his hand, and he said that he could not help but step forward. I only listened to Yingqiong and said, &ldquo;I want to miss the male sister, and I intend to call Brother Jinyan to carry her and open up Ningbi Cliff with us. I don&rsquo;t want Brother Jinyan to come back. Ask it to be at home, and it only shook her head. Did she go out with her Master again? &quot;</p>
<p>Lingyun said:&rdquo; The god sculpture flew back, presumably the heroes were not in the middle. What does it mean? How do you use it? This is difficult to solve. &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as he said, the god sculpture used its steel beak, pulled Yingqiong&rsquo;s corner a few times, and longed for the long time. Two sounds. Ying Qiong said to everyone: &ldquo;I have a lot of days with Brother Jinyan. It can guess its movement nineteen. This will ask me to get rid of the slopes. Therefore, Er brought her half -arm and told me to go to see her? &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as the words were finished, the god sculpture shook her head twice, and Ying Qiong was puzzled. Zhu Wendao: &ldquo;How difficult is this. Anyway, it is not far from this liberation. Why do we have to discuss it? I think the sky is not too early. Please ask the masters and sisters to open up the Ningbi Cliff. Go to the liberationpot to see it. If you are sick, there is still the old elixir of the second older of Songshan here. Take two capsules with her and carry her here. &quot;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong heard that he was overjoyed and would be relieved. The direction of the slope said with Zhu Wen, and asked Zhu Wen to ride carving. The carving did not wait for Ying Qiong to order, and squatted down from Zhu Wen. Zhu Wen became more happy, riding on the carved back, and one back to Xiang, he flew up.  Here, everyone was anxious to open up Ningbi Cliff, everyone joked all the way, and walked back to the cave. As soon as I walked in front of the cave door, Ying Qiong suddenly turned back, &ldquo;咦&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Lingyun asked why. Ying Qiong said: &ldquo;The original liberation is not far from here. Why did the god carving not fall there and flew towards the southwest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After many years of listening to the scriptures, non -ordinary fairy poultry is comparable. Looking at the spirit of Wenmei from Wenmei, there must be a reason for this. This carving industry has all been on the gods, and Wenmei is not weak. When she comes back, we will know. Our business. &quot;  After that, Ying Qiong was leading the way in front of him, and Lingyun waited in the back, in the direction specified by Miao Yi&rsquo;s wife. It turned out to be a half stone room, and the stone wall at the end was very solid. The estimated location was right, and the purple smoke was taken out by Ruolan and hit the stone wall. Immediately the purple light, full of smoke clouds, large stones flew with. Without a dozen times, the stone walls of these feet have been hoeed with a long six -foot, two -foot -wide stone gate, and they are in and out of each other as much as possible. Lingyun stopped Ruolan and slowly started, first went in. It turned out that it was the backdoor portal here, and the stone wall was closed from elsewhere. There are only two feet in the cave, and there is still a slope. It comes down to Judong. Next to it is the thousands of bangs, the clouds are filled with the clouds and the bottom. In the cave, there is a Zhang Xu square and a large stone with a thick three -foot -thick stone on it. The feet are spells. Knowing that the following is the shortcut of Tong Ning Biya. Ruo Lan came in, stood in a good direction, and hoeed the stone. After hoeing, the golden light sparkled, the stone was still motionless, and the treasure of your half of the master Zhenshan was also invalid. When Lingyun saw the purple smoke, he had no achievements, and knew that it was the Dharma of the Bai Meng monk. He quickly stopped Ruolan and led everyone to kneel. Wish you to get up, and a golden light in front of him, the spell on the stone is gone. Then he ordered Ruolan to do it again. This time, the big stone was broken. Lingyun and Yingqiong also pulled out the sword at the same time to do it. They couldn&rsquo;t stand the meal, and the large stone was smashed into a crushing, and a stone hole was available. Ruo Lan pulled the stone in the stone cave away by the way. When Lingyun saw the black hole below, he said, &quot;</p>
<p>This hole is definitely a shortcut of Tong Ningbi Cliff. Wenmei went to liberate toro again, and the black hole in the bottom below did not know the depth. Just wait for her to come back, and use the Tianyu mirror to look at it. Let&rsquo;s go down. &ldquo;Ruo Lanmeng thought that Jin Chan was a pair of wisdom, he could look at things in the dark, and he could lead everyone. Looking back, it was not in front. It turned out that when Zhu Wen rode carved, Jin Chan wanted to play with him, and he could use it to make a word with Zhu Wen. He was afraid of his sister&rsquo;s obstruction and walked behind everyone. Lingyun and others were eager to open up Ningbi Cliff and never noticed him. When he saw everyone entering the hole, he pushed and chased Zhu Wen early. Lingyun&rsquo;s cash cicada was not followed, guessing to catch up with Zhu Wen. Both of them were not here and could not go on, so they had to wait for the two of him to come back.  Who knew that after two hours of waiting, Zhu Wen and Jin Chan had to turn back. I met Ying Qiong and said, &quot;</p>
<p>The Yu Yingnan you said was probably snatched.&rdquo; Ying Qiong was shocked and asked. Zhu Wendao: &quot;</p>
<p>After I rode on the carving, I went straight to the six or seven hundred miles of Mount Emei, and I never landed down. My party was very strange. From time to time, the god carving looked back at me long. Quick, fly out for hundreds of miles, and fall into an unknown mountain. Not far from the carving back, see a cave house, the cave door is closed, and the scenery of the four outside is very good. Suddenly running over and squatting down, that means me to ride. I was so tired that it was tired first, took a break, and then flew forward. Whoever thought that I rode up twice, it would fly to the car. After a while, I met the cicada brother and rode together to carve the back. Then I flew to the liberation of the liberation of what you said. Seeing an old Buddha, I was sad, there was a sutra, and I read the scriptures there. I was very scared. I explained her intention to her, and she said that she was too employed by Guangming Shi, and later followed Guanghui Master. Guanghui was sitting in Benji five days ago. After being buried, Ying Men said that Master was left and asked her to go to the Mountains of Emei to go to Sister Yingqiong. She also knew that you had not returned out, and went to Houshan to see you back. On the third day, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, he suddenly. He came to an aunt named Yin, saying that it was fate with her, and he wanted to accept her as an apprentice. Ying Nan went to the mountain to practice the road. The heroic wants to delay. When you come back to see the previous side, it takes a lot of lips, and the aunt can stay for two days. She may come back to find her, and come to the Houshan Mountain with you. Leave a letter. This morning, the aunt took her away. In the season, she sent everything in the temple to the old Buddha. I repeatedly told that if she left, if there was a little girl named Li after leaving When you come, you will explain the above situation in detail, and it must be critical. Then the old Buddha has made me wrong as you, and then tells me many situations. I asked her what the aunt looked like. At the age of a few years, he didn&rsquo;t speak very clearly. Listening to her tone, that aunt was not a good person, and the British man must be forced to be unable to be forced. It is unknown. &quot;  When Xian Xian heard her words, she suddenly remembered that when she entered the hole yesterday, she picked up a letter on the stone table and wrote &quot;</p>
<p>Qiong Mei Demolition.&rdquo; At that time, Ying Qiong was fed and carved, and because he saw many people, he had a good intention to collect it for Ying Qiong. Somehow, when he fell asleep, he forgot the matter. Listening to Zhu Wen&rsquo;s situation, Yingnan was still in the temple last night, and this morning was forced away by the aunt. Isn&rsquo;t he misunderstood others? Can&rsquo;t help but be shy and anxious, and I&rsquo;m embarrassed. I was embarrassed, and I suddenly heard Yingqiong in a hurry: &quot;</p>
<p>The old Buddha said that Ying Ying and sister went to me to the hole before leaving. How can we see it?&rdquo; Then to conceal, fortunately, I was an unintentional loss, and I was busy interfaced: &quot;</p>
<p>When I entered the hole yesterday, I saw a letter next to the stone couch, and I did not see what I wrote above. I was stuffed under the mattress, and I didn&rsquo;t know if it was or not? &ldquo;Ying Qiong heard the words, and then answered with Xianxian. He hurried to the couch and took out the letter. The letter said in the letter:
Ten days ago, Ying Nan came to find her in Houshan, and saw that the door was closed tightly, thinking that she was leisurely on the left, looking for it again, and there was no trace.</p>
<p>At first, she was suspected of riding and carved, and then came several times in a row.</p>
<p>The last time she moved the stones in the hole and saw the left letter, she knew that she was attracted to the Kunlun female sword fairy phenomenon in Kunlun.</p>
<p>Buddha slaves flew beforehand.</p>
<p>She couldn&rsquo;t think for a while, so she had to go back and told Guanghui Master.</p>
<p>Guang Hui was so surprised that she was accepted by the phenomenon.</p>
<p>She said that the phenomenon had been separated from the Kunlun school when she was now.</p>
<p>He also said that he would be silent in the next day.</p>
<p>I wanted to call Ying Nan to live with her in Houshan.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to make mistakes in the middle of the way.</p>
<p>Yingnan was worried about his friends, but he also asked the teacher to be forever.</p>
<p>He was sad in his heart.</p>
<p>Two days later, Guang Hui was sitting too much.</p>
<p>The old Buddha was originally a well -known female flying thief on the Xichuan Road to catch invincible Tang family.</p>
<p>Because of robbery, he was too close to Guanghui Master because of his family.</p>
<p>Essence After the young man Tang Jiajia buried Guanghui, he came to Hou Mountain to see Ying Qiong returned.</p>
<p>The meaning of Ying Nan thought that Ying Qiong couldn&rsquo;t come back for the time being, and the god sculpting Buddha slave always came back.</p>
<p>If you meet the magic carving, ask him to carry himself on the Bai Mei Zen Master and ask the Bai Mei Zen Master: If the phenomenon is a good person, he can find it to find it and worship Ying Qiong under her door; Tang is a bad guy, but he is good for Zen Master Baimei to rescue Ying Qiong and still return to Emei.</p>
<p>Who knows several times and never meet.</p>
<p>On the third day, I went to Houshan again.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she met a middle -aged female aunt, claiming that she was a female sword fairy phenomenon, and she called Ying Nan back with her.</p>
<p>Later, I asked Ming Lai, and I realized that she asked Akashito to lead Yingqiong, passing by Mang Cangshan, and met the enemy Shi Nanxi, and was seriously injured.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Zhu Mei, who met Songshan&rsquo;s second old and middle -aged, gave a few killed God Dan before he had to keep his life.</p>
<p>He had been able to raise his life for a few days.</p>
<p>IPN I heard that Li Yingqiong, who was going to go back to the door, was left in a broken temple in Mang Cang Mountain.</p>
<p>Because Shi Nanxi and the ancestor of the fire could not be found for a while, let go of revenge first, and hurriedly drove the sword light.</p>
<p>Looking for Yingqiong along the way, there was no trace.</p>
<p>Guess she had turned Emei from the original road, so I was tracking here, but Ying Qiong did not go home.</p>
<p>When I met the hero, she had to accept her as an apprentice when she saw that her roots were thick.</p>
<p>Yingnan heard that Ying Qiong was left alone on the way.</p>
<p>Because he heard that Master said that the phenomenon was not a good person, he couldn&rsquo;t help but happy to see Ying Qiong.</p>
<p>But listening to Yin Sutang said that Ying Qiong was alone in the deserted mountains, and was not found, and was very worried.</p>
<p>Coupled with the phenomenon of seeking Xun Yingqiong, she insisted on taking her away, scared, and unwilling.</p>
<p>Later, the phenomenon was forced to use the flying sword, and the English man was forced to be helpless.</p>
<p>He repeatedly complained that after the hypothesis, please stay in the liberation and live in the middle for a few days, and then go with her.</p>
<p>Essence The British man&rsquo;s mouth was sweet, and a set of words of words actually coaxed the phenomenon, but she was not allowed to be extended, and she could only wait for another two days.</p>
<p>The British man couldn&rsquo;t, had to agree.</p>
<p>Her original intention was because Ying Qiongxin said that the god sculpture only came back for ten days.</p>
<p>She wanted to return to the god carving and rode away.</p>
<p>He also said to Yin Sutang that she and Ying Qiong were in love with Ying Qiong.</p>
<p>At first, she didn&rsquo;t want to go with her, because she couldn&rsquo;t bear Ying Qiong.</p>
<p>Ask phenomenon to allow her to go to Houshan in the past two days, and visit Yingqiong to come back.</p>
<p>If she comes back and worships her with her, isn&rsquo;t it good?</p>
<p>In these few words, I really wished to know that Ying Nan would not fly swords, and did not worry about her escape.</p>
<p>Seeing that Yingnan was angry with a child, he said sincerely, and agreed to her.</p>
<p>Ying Nan was carrying the phenomenon, and secretly wrote this long letter, staying with Ying Qiong, and Tuo Yingqiong returned.</p>
<p>Please be a god sculpting to the jujubea Yaosangtang back and fled to the Bai Mei Zen master together.</p>
<p>An wait.</p>
<p>After reading this letter, Ying Qiong was sad, and she almost shed tears.</p>
<p>At the moment, she asked Lingyun to try to save Ying Nan.</p>
<p>Lingyun said: I see that phenomenal has loved talents so much, and Ying Nan is in danger.</p>
<p>We do not want her to return to the door and pick her back, it is right.</p>
<p>But I do n’t need to be busy at this time.</p>
<p>When I open up the Ningbi Cliff, how about the long -term guidance?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone heard the words, and they all agreed. Although Yingqiong was anxious, he had to let Lingyun schedule. At the moment, he entered the stone cave again, and Lingyun first ordered Zhu Wen and Jin Chan to hold the front of the sky. At the beginning of the beginning, the hole only allowed one person to enter and exit, plus the gravel that fell down to the road, the top was not high, so the fish had to lean down. After walking, there were dozens of feet and near, and suddenly felt the air became fresh. Lingyun was busy calling Zhu Wen to pick up the treasure mirror. Sure enough, seeing a light, the same as the dawn came out in the morning. Then I walked down there, and I walked around a few bends. To the end, it turned out to be out of the hole, and there was a cliff in front of it. The upper and lower half of the hole, extended it flat, only a hole of about a few feet was exposed on it, and there was nothing in the four outside. Looking up, I saw that the clouds were filled with the clouds, reaching out to pick up, I could not see the blue sky, and I didn&rsquo;t know how high it was. Then go to the side of the cliff, look down, below is also a cloud partition, and the bottom is invisible. Ruo Lan laughed out: &quot;</p>
<p>Is this Ningbi Cliff? There is no sky on the outside, there is no sight, and there are such black holes in the cave. ? &quot;  Before the words, Jin Chan suddenly shouted: &quot;</p>
<p>Here!&rdquo; It turned out that everyone at first thought that Mrs. Yiyi said that Ningbi Cliff was a place where the white eyebrow monk Zhanyue, but even Jiuhua did not go back, only here, only here Xue Dao, estimated that there must be beautiful scenery. When it came down, it was full of curiosity. After walking for a while, the dark road is so easy to have a bright future, full of joy. When it came to the end, it was a dead cliff mouth that was not born and boring. In addition to Lingyun&rsquo;s age, knowing that Mrs. Miao Yiyi told everyone to live, either he had no intention, or he had not yet reached the ground. Ying Qiong is a person who has been to, and I already know that this is not Ningbi Cliff. Most of the people were disappointed. Before Rong Yingqiong spoke, Ruo Lan had already spoken to be dissatisfied. The Jin Chan was even more anxious. He saw that the cliffs were covered by the clouds, and could not help but say that Zhu Wenbao mirror was grabbed into his hand, revealed the brocade, and took a picture below. Coupled with his pair of wisdom eyes, Xia Guang was everywhere, and the clouds were flushed below. I saw a wide cliff below. There were many strange flowers and flowers on the cliffs. House. I was happy in my heart and shouted madly.  At this time, Ying Qiong was facing Lingyun: &quot;</p>
<p>This is not Ningbi Cliff. I have been there in Ningbi Cliff. Where is this like this?&rdquo; Everyone heard that Jin Chan was happy, and they were all around. Without Jin Chan, it is clear that the mountains and water shadows below are also seen, green and green, and there are no holes. It really deserves the word &quot;</p>
<p>Ningbi&rdquo;. Everyone discussed the sword light. Lingyun said: &quot;</p>
<p>I think this road stops here, and you must go to the sword light to go down. It is not so simple. The mother not only told us to open up from it, and there must be roads. In the case, Qiu and Li&rsquo;s sisters would not fly by the sword. How can I go down? &ldquo;Jin Chan said:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sister always thinks about it before and slowly. ? As for Qiu and Li&rsquo;s sister, you have a strong sword and Sister Zhu, and you will not carry them down? &ldquo;Lingyun said:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it that saying. Fearless, only half of it. Ying Qiong&rsquo;s sister has a immortal bone, and she has a sip of a fairy sword. She ate a lot of fairy medicine and the fruit. She is as light as leaves. , Can fly to the royal sword. Sister Xianxian is much more rare. She has to practice at least three years and five years. I often get in and out in the future. Only I can take her in and out. Cicada still has to argue, Zhu Wen first said, &ldquo;Since we see the scenery below, it is not necessarily that Ningbi Cliff is not necessarily. With no, we went to find the shortcut below that below, wouldn&rsquo;t it be good? &quot;</p>
<p>Jin Chan listened to these words, and he was convinced and orally. Lingyun had to agree. Then it agreed that Lingyun brought Xianxian, Zhu Wen brought Yingqiong, together with Ruolan and Jin Chan, there were six people.  I was about to raise my fullness, and I heard the sculpture on the top. Ying Qiong heard that it was a Buddha&rsquo;s slave, and he stopped and stopped for a while. After a while, it was true that the Buddha slave was in the pore of the cliff, and the wings were down, sitting on the back with the gorilla. Ruo Lan laughed: &ldquo;This orangutan will enjoy blessings. Could it be that the god carving is carried and goes to Ningbi Cliff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were not yet, and the god sculpture had flew in front of Yingqiong. Seeing the owner, the orangutan jumped off the carved back and lay on the ground. Ying Qiong said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have to carry by Sister Qiu, Sister Qiu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, I pulled the Xianxian riding and carved back. The two of them were sitting firmly, pushing them down, stretched the two steel claws, grabbed the underground orangutan, opened the wings horizontally, and flew down in the hole. Ruo Lan slapped his hands and laughed: &ldquo;They are good at playing. In the future, when I meet a chance, it will also be good to ride a god sculpture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhu Wen said: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to envy others, let&rsquo;s go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same is the same. &quot; Jin Chan, Lingyun, and Ruolan drove the sword light, flew down, and worked for a while.
Ying Qiong and Xianxian have arrived first, laughing at the crowd: &ldquo;This is the Ningbi Cliff, and I have been carried by Brother Jinyan in the past. You see, there are two big characters on the cliff wall there. ? &quot;</p>
<p>Lingyun waited for a look forward, and it turned out that there were two big characters&rdquo; Ningbi &quot;</p>
<p>on the cliff in front of the cliff. The spirit of going. The Ningbi Cliff is tied with the lone peak, with seventy or eighty feet high. The vines on the cliff wall are covered with many unknown strange flowers, touching the nose and fragrance. Strange, there is a strange stone on the corner, a rough waterfall with a two -year thickness, flying from the stone end. With the tens of feet from the strange stone, it is another half -acre square, about ten feet high, about ten feet high. , Shangfeng Xiarui, straight pipes, are straight, and the peaks are like a bowl, and the large waterfall is inherited. Water and gas are like clouds and fog. On the top of the peak, a thunderous noise was made. The waterfall reached the top of the peak, and there were many heights splashed. First, because it is the original dusual of the upper and lower Rui, some waterfalls flow into thin and transparent crystal curtains, some are thick to a few feet, and some are thin like a long rope. A deep pool, flowing around the cliff. On the water falling stone, the sound of the sound of the springs, accompanied by the spring in the pond, the festival of the middle of the festival, it looks like a wonderful music. The sound of bombardment will forget. The splashed tens of millions of water drops falling on the green grass, shiny, one by one, like a pearl, rolling from the wind from time to time. It shows that the soil fertilizer is green, and the flowers are laughing.  When everyone met such a fairy scene, they stood there without any sound, listening to the immortal sound of nature, the endless beauty of the eyes, and the breath of the same way was to stop. Jin Chan was happy, and suddenly he whispered in silence. Everyone cheered and jumped up unknowingly, and praised together for a while. Ying Qiong also looked at a towering old Nan tree in front of the cliff, the towering old nan tree with a few acres of ground, referring to Lingyun and so on, saying that this tree was the place where the white eyebrow monk was raised in the past. many.  I was happy, and suddenly a black shadow flew from the top of the tree, and then slipped again, slipped down a black thing, and frightened the Xianxian. Looking at it, it turned out that the sculpture was carrying the orangutan, and the orangutan claw was holding a bunch of Buddhist beads with the same note. Ying Qiong took a look, and it was the monk of Shi Zi Baimei. It is said that he has already calculated that they are going to live here. There is a cave on the cliff, and there are more than a hundred stone rooms in the cliff. It has become a fairy, and no one has been used. Since the monk Baimei has borrowed it here, a spirit spring has been opened, and many of them have been transplanted from various famous mountains and blessings. The stones in the stone cave were originally a transparent texture, light day and night, and the most suitable monastery lived. There is a rising road on the west side of the cave gate, which is directly in the stone cave next to the Dianfu House of the Fairy Fairy Li Yuanhua, Fei Ling, Houshan. There is also a rising road to the south, which is the Qiyun Cave where Li Ning&rsquo;s father and daughter live. The bead was given to Yingqiong, and later he had his own words.  Seeing that her father was mentioned on the note, Ying Qiong couldn&rsquo;t help but move her thoughts and shed tears. When Ling Yun persuaded a few words, when she took the bunch of beads in her hands, there were only eighteen grains. It is lightly fluttering in my hand, non -gold, non -jade, non -wood and stone, uniform and round, with longan -like size. The black light of Wuguang, the hair of the person. Knowing that it is a treasure, it must be useful in the future, and it will still be handed over to Ying Qiong.</p>
