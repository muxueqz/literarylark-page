    <p>1 00 Back to sucking snow skin spiritual material shows that Xianzang peeketed Bicen Tiger and was fooled  Ying Qiong and Ruolan entered Taiyuan Cave.</p>
<p>The two discussed and ordered the god sculpture to find the fall of the male man.</p>
<p>I still memorized her back, I couldn&rsquo;t go down, and quickly came back to send the letter.</p>
<p>After speaking, Man thought that the god carving was going to go, who knew that the god sculpture could not help shaking his head and did not fly away.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong panicked and asked, &ldquo;You refuse to go, Mo Fei Yingnan has been trapped in Luo.com? No longer the enemy is terrible and can&rsquo;t get closer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The god sculpture still shook his head long. Ying Qiong cannot. After seeing Ruolan returning to the cave, after speaking a few words, she used to work hard, her face was green for a while, and purple for a while. Although she didn&rsquo;t say it, she must be abnormal and more anxious. It is also necessary to say to the god sculpture that the god sculpture suddenly walked out and had to go back to condolences Ruolan. I couldn&rsquo;t say a few words, and I saw Zhixian run in with a smile. In Ying Qiong&rsquo;s heart, she hadn&rsquo;t opened her mouth yet. That Zhixian had been on Ruolan, and she couldn&rsquo;t live in her left placket sleeve, her mouth. Ying Qiong said: &ldquo;Sister Lan was injured, her hands were disabled, can Zhixian save her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhixian shook her head and only stretched her hands into Ruo Lan&rsquo;s sleeves. Ruo Lan was swollen with his left hand, his sleeves could not be liberated, and he felt uncomfortable. Seeing this so, she knew that she had a intention, so she asked Ying Qiong to cut her sleeves and tears. Ying Qiong turned her sleeve, and she was almost sticky with flesh. On weekdays, a pink arm that looks like the cricket is also the thickness of the feet, and the flesh is red and purple. Nine -eyed eye industry has swollen the size of the tea cup and DC is dark. I felt sorry, I couldn&rsquo;t help crying. Looking at Zhixian, she was already standing on Ruolan&rsquo;s knees, holding her injured arm, and she couldn&rsquo;t help but use her small mouth. After Lan was injured, it became more and more time -long, and the pain became more and more painful. Knowing that this needle has no antidote, Lingyun and so on returning may not be able to rescue. If you do n’t stand it, you ca n’t stand it again. If you really ca n’t stand it, you want to hit your own life. Long pain is not as good as short pain. Only by Ying Qiong, it is necessary to stop it, and it is difficult to start, so she has to endure the pain for the time being. At this time, he was stunned by Zhixian, and he felt that the injuries were cool for a while.  Zheng and Zhixian said thanked, and suddenly saw Yuan Xing and Xianxian walking together to condolences. When asked about Xianxian, Yuan Xing first got the god of carving, and the god sculpture was on behalf of it. Yuan Xing informed that he knew. After Yuan Xing and the two saw the gift, they said that it knew the god carving in the world. The talented god sculpture was anxious to see the owner, and today&rsquo;s things were not able to understand what they could understand. Essence Ying Qiong heard the words of joy and was busy asking. Yuan Xingdao: &ldquo;Gang Yu said that it was ordered to find Yu Xiangu, and knew that Yu Xiangu did not far away, so he walked back and forth hundreds of miles around Yu Xiangu&rsquo;s road, looking for details, and did not see a trace. Flying through the jujube cliff, not far away from the Black Valley, relying on a pair of gods, flying into the valley to visit, and met a Taoist. The man was proficient in various bird language and recruited the steel feather. The poultry people and the public and smell Huang. It is said that Yu Xiangu searched for the owner to the Mang Cangshan, and fell into the Black Valley by mistake. Kurogu&rsquo;s dense road to Mang Cangshan not only is much near, but also avoids the enemy&rsquo;s chase. He also told Gang Yu that Emei will meet each other soon, and he knows that the owners are in Emei because Yu Xiangu There are still many fairy adventure to Mang Cang, so I just guided the road of Yu Xiangu alone. I did not say where the owners are. It is called Gang Yu to go to find her at this time. The sun is moving. At this time, it is not beneficial to each other. Gang Yu probably knows the origin of the person, so it turns back. &quot;</p>
<p>The god carving is psychic, Yuan Xing&rsquo;s words have no errors, and Ying Qiong slightly relieved. After a while, Sister Nan and Yu Jian and Yang Chengzhi would also come in to condolences. If Lan was inconvenient to bare the arm, he only called Nangu in and looked out. He said that with the three people, Ying Qiong ordered Yuan Xing and the god sculpture to take turns to guard in the back of the cave. Accompany Ruolan in the cave. If Lang Jingzhixian was stuck, although the wound was not disappeared, the pain stopped a lot, so he went to the broken arms.  Everyone is not very happy because of Ruolan&rsquo;s injury. In fact, Ying Qiong had a good look at the new four people. As soon as the four of them came, they first caught up with Ying Qiong and Ruolan. They were poisoned at the beginning of the poisoning and were not interested. Not fast; Later, Li and Shen were busy looking for Ying men to come back, and they couldn&rsquo;t care about the four of them. The four of them arrived at first, and except for Xianxian&rsquo;s familiarity, after Ying Qiong&rsquo;s last time, she did not know that she was afraid in her heart and did not dare to get close to Li and Shen. Nan Gu was clever, and blindly restrained his brother Hu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s dedication. Yu Jian&rsquo;s sexuality, had no chests, and worried about it since he was a child. He knew that this time he was a immortal fairy. Because Yang Chengzhi made a disaster, he did not dare to walk around without ordering the order of Xianxian. Only Yang Chengzhi lost his parents since he was a child and went to the bundle without a tube. Although he was talented, he was not engaged in temperament. He was the most selfish and loved. At the beginning of Ningbi Cliff, at first sight, he had a great wish. Seeing Yingqiong, Ruo Lan and others not only excellent skills, but also one more than one of the beauty of the beauty, the peerlessness of the light, and the stronger than Nanu, the more happy, the more you can&rsquo;t get close to them. Who knew that Li and Shen had never even seen him with their eyes. Soon after, because of the shocking Chi Xian, eating Yingqiong in public and saying a meal in public, I didn&rsquo;t feel embarrassed. In particular, I was afraid that Ying Qiong told the teacher in the future that he was irritable, not a big device, regretted, and was amazing. Because the people in the mountains attached so much on Zhixian, I thought of the listening to people before that in the deep mountains, there are often ganoderma and Shouwu and other elixir cultivation. Eating raw can become immortals, presumably this thing. I am strange that since I was in danger in the Demon Road Cave, the male and female sword fairy that they met, except for the Ling Zhenren dressed by the Huazi, sent four people to Liu Zhenren who went to Ningbi Cliff. It is only twenty years old, especially the name of the small fairy boy with a cicada character and the little fairy named Li, which is younger than himself. Essence I want to meet a chance to inquire carefully. On the second day, Nan Guo lived in a room with Xianxian, and listened to the origin of Zhixian and the preciousness of Zhixian&rsquo;s blood, so everyone in the whole mountain loved it and told Hu&rsquo;er. Nan Gu Yuan told Hu&rsquo;er, telling him not to see Zhixian, and he was aware of himself. Tiger and Yu and Yang lived together in the first room, and said in the chat. The speaker was unintentional, and the listener intentionally, Yang Chengzhi felt that he was expected. It is also clever, thinking that there must be a secret affection, outsiders are hard to know, and the opportunity will be said. Hearing Ruolan was injured again, Zhixian would be better, and he became more motivated.  It is also Shi Xian to suffer. It gave Ruolan for a while, gradually hurt, and lived in his mouth, still sitting on Ruolan, playing with Ying Qiong and Xianxian. Ying Qiong said: &ldquo;On that day, you originally led us to find fairy grass. You were shocked by the newcomers. In the future, if you have something to do, you have not been looking for you. Is there any immortal grass now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhixian Wenwen In words, shook his little finger at the sky. After a while, I earned the ground and walked out. Ying Qiong didn&rsquo;t know its intention, so she asked Xianxian to go to see if she guided the grass. Xian Xian heard the words chased out. Shi Xian looked back at Xianxian and stopped, seemed to be waiting for her to go with her. Xianxian invited it to lead the way. As soon as the entrance of Taiyuan Dong, when she met Yang Chengzhi, the sister Yu Jian and Nan Gu were behind, and they were coming. When Zhixian saw Yang Chengzhi, he exclaimed, and turned back to his arms. Shi Xian hugged it quickly and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of Zhixian. They are all in the book in the future. They come to ignorance at the beginning of the day, and they will mistake you and will not hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhixian is still a spirit of strength. Xian&rsquo;s arms hid. Yang Chengzhi and other four people saw such a scene, stopped together, and did not dare to step forward. Xian Xianjue lived in the future, and Chi Xian traveled every day. It was difficult for him to meet without intention. I ca n’t help it with words, and I also call four people to meet each other separately. Please do n’t doubt Zhixian. When the four saw that the Zhixian was long, she was born white and tender. When they were close, they heard a fragrance. All of them loved to the extreme. After the fourth explanation of the Chi Xian Jing Xian Xian, she opened a pair of big eyes that she wanted to live, looking at the four people twice, smiling. Tiger&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s heart, relying on Xian Xian&rsquo;s good speech, she walked approaching her face, fingering Zhixian Wenwen&rsquo;s little hand. At first sight, Nan Gu was shocked and was about to scold. That Zhixian had a fate with him. Not only did he not hide, he stretched out his small hand to tease the Hu&rsquo;er. The heart was blooming, and even Xianxian felt strange. Seeing that Xian Xian was unwilling to be fascinating, he dared not care about it, and couldn&rsquo;t help making his eyes on the tiger. He told him to retreat. When Yu and Yang felt fun, when they wanted to learn, the Zhixian had broken away from Xian Xian&rsquo;s arms, jumped down the ground, and walked forward. Xianxian followed. When Yang Chengzhi saw it, he was happy, but he deliberately said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s take a look with Qiu Xiangu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, the first one followed behind Xianxian. Yu Jian, Hu&rsquo;er, and Nanu all followed their hearts and followed. Xianxian is inorganic and has not been prohibited.
That Zhixian jumped, and walked through the mountains.</p>
<p>From time to time, high cliffs, adopt a red peel, shaped like golden oranges, and bite the whole.</p>
<p>Seeing that Zhixian loves to eat this wild fruit, Yang Chengzhi also wants to take one, which is full of mountains and flowers, but this fruit is very scarce.</p>
<p>Seeing that Nan Gu aunt and waited, Yuxian called Nangu and said, &ldquo;This kind of fruits eaten by Zhixian, named Cui Shi, can be eaten clearly, it is a kind of fairy grass. Such as wild mulberry, each of which is a green on the top of the plant. It is spring in four o&rsquo;clock here, blooming every month, and the results of the two months. Each result, Zhixian searches all over the mountains. , I ’m reluctant to eat it, leaving it for it uniquely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it was walking under a cliff, full of cliffs, ruminum and chopsticks. Below the cliff is a wide stream, the blue wave is transparent, clear, and the green water is far away from the sound of Xianxingquan. Ming Bo Ruo Jing, the backstream of the mountains, Baiyun sliced, from time to time on the bottom of the water. This place is called Zihua Cliff and Embroidery Cloud, which is the most clear Wenxiu in Ningbi Xianjing. Although the crowd has been here several times, they can&rsquo;t help lingering and praised, and said while walking. Suddenly, Zhixian went to the cliff, a few feet away from the ground, and climbed Zhu Teng with one hand and turned up. Xian Xianfang wanted to go up with him. Chi Xian had already taken advantage of six or seven Cui Shi in his hand. Five of them were handed out, and he referred to four people, which means that he was split to four people to eat. Xianxian smiled and eaten with four people. The population was very bitter. After eating, she returned to her sweet mouth. Everyone thanked Zhixian and walked forward. Turning around the cliff is a small hillside, the slope is cultivated with vines and bamboo. In the middle of the Qi Shifeng, the pieces are exquisitely thin and thin, and there are many holes. If music advocates from the stone, it will play with the Shengquan Shengsheng to become a sound. The new four people, but here, all of them, all of them are strange. Zhixian said: &ldquo;This is called Xianyin San, which is a place where Zhixian is playing with the moon. Although it is not rooted here, it comes here to worship the Star Dou every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, entering the deep part of the bamboo forest, there is a natural stone platform. There is the size of the acres of the acre. There are two jade stoves on the stage, and there are four stone pier in front of the furnace. The stone -colored dark green is like jade. At this time, after the Zhixianye had come to the stage, a jade jade was on the front. There were thirty feet high, and it was ten feet. No. Shi Xian walked to the peak and stopped, pulled Xianxian with his little hand, pointed at a larger hole in front of the peak, and taught Xianxian to see. The four people also looked at the middle cave in the middle of the Cuishi with Yixian. Only when I got up, I heard a fragrance straight through the nose, and my mind was refreshing. The holes that Xianxian saw was larger, and he saw a few clusters of red and green flowers and plants. The people only smelled the fragrance and could not see anything.  Shi Xian asked Zhixian: &ldquo;Is that grass growing in this Ling Cuifeng stone belly? Two months ago, the master and sister said that the former Dantai was the place where the ancestor master alchemy. It was moved from him, and there must be a treasure below the peak. How much did everyone spend later, but I did n’t go away from this small peak. Check it for many days. How did you take it out a few days ago? ? &quot;</p>
<p>When Zhixian heard the words, he put his little hand into the cave and took it for a while. He took out a piece of jade like a lotus. He compared to the entrance of the cave first, and pressed it as seamless. If you do n’t know it in advance, I do n’t know that this green lotus is the key of this spirit peak. Although no strange Lingyun, although I thought that there must be treasure under Lingfeng at the beginning, they would not be able to see it. Xian Xian took off the jade -shaped jade jade, and there were a few lines of Zhu Shuwen on the back. After careful decision, I realized that after the real people of Changmei opened the eighteen fairy scenery, they had two furnace elixir in Mo Yutai in front of Mo Yutai. Later, Xuan Tian&rsquo;s secret Olympiad, soon soared, the two furnace elixir could not use it. To be given to the disciples under the door, and because of all the disciples all the hobbies, although the deepening of the Taoism is different, the alchemy has a real pass, and they do not want them to be greedy and obtain. Counting the Grand Ben, you must stay in Sanying and Er Yun. At that time, the factions of the Zhengxie suffered unprecedented catastrophe. This generation of disciples have been in, and they have been in the same time. Below this Ling Cui Peak is the origin of the Lingmai of Emei all mountains, and the two furnace elixir was buried below, and the fairy method was used to practice for 1008 days. In the deepest day of the day, the elixir of the elixir, and the aura of the sky blessed and the aura of the cave became a kind of fairy grass. The fairy grass is called Danzhu Cao, Bi Yan Zhuye, which is red like fire, is as bright as crystal jade, one leaf and two Qi, among which Qi tip is tied with Zhu Shi. Not only did he eat the prolonged life, no matter what the magic magic weapon was poisoned by any demons, he took the leaf leaf and took it up and immediately returned to life. Therefore, the grass mature must be mature for many years. I am afraid that the outsiders have discovered that they have taken a Lingcui Peak formed by the 10,000 -year -old green coral from the bottom of the sea. After many years, this grass borrowed heaven and earth aura mature and strong. At the same time, in addition to the spiritual symbols that protect the fairy grass, the outer symbols have been released. The fairy grass is a total of nine plants, each of which is born of yin and yang. After leaf picking, it is necessary to have a strong secondary leaves after 36 years. There are myself, there is no fairy, you can&rsquo;t take it deliberately, there must be disaster. At that time, the disciples Qi Shumi had their own arrangements. At first sight, Xianxian was happy. Because of the heavy holding, I dare not come delusion in everything, and quickly greeted everyone to turn around and report to discuss with Li and Shen. That Zhixian also seemed very happy, but refused to go back with Xianxian. Xian Xian returned to Taiyuan Cave and ordered the four to play around nearby, and reported to the cave.  At first sight, Ying Qiong saw the magic of the real people on the eyebrows, and was very happy. Just listening to the arranged by the teacher, I dare not take it at each other. Although Ruolan&rsquo;s pain was slightly stopped, the wound was not cured. If Lingyun came back, he was in charge of the teacher. Ruo Lan had a heavy affairs and has been in a heavy age, and has been with the Red Flower for many years. With experience, he would rather suffer more sins, and he did not dare to violate his ancestors&rsquo; law. Ying Qiong went to Ling Cui Peak to see it for a while. Seeing that the grass was born in the peak, it was expected that she was not right. He returned to discuss with Xianxian and Ruolan. Except for Lingyun&rsquo;s idea, there was no good policy, but he only stopped for a while.  Xianfu is bright day and night, and the diet of the newlylands is greeted by Xianxian. At this time, Yingqiong and Ruo Lan were able to open up, and they could be casual. Only Xianxian has not been completely banned. Usually, Yuan Xing went to wash the application of fire and vegetables, and got the stone cave of Tibetan Valley in the past in the past in the past in the past. When Xianxian had nothing to do, he made various strange flowers and fairy fruits of Xianfu into medicinal wine to prepare for the same door and went to drink two cups with the same. The cave was originally clean, and was arranged by the Xianxian for many days. The crowd named the hole again, called a fairy chef. The four people also eat with Xianxian in Xianxian. On this day, Xianxian turned around from Ling Cuifeng, talked with Ying Qiong and Ruolan for a while, and arranged for the four people&rsquo;s bedrooms, and still returned to Ruolan&rsquo;s room. Because Xianxian said how smart Nanu was, weird, Ying Qiong Su loved to be lively, and remembered that because of something for a long time, he didn&rsquo;t care about the new people who had talked more, so he asked Shixian to call Nan Gu to come to the room to the room. Inside, accompany Ruolan to talk about the sky. Xian Xian called the South Aunt as a word, and everyone talked quite speculative. After a while, Ying Qiong saw Nan Gu&rsquo;s tiredness, and he and Xianxian should also work hard. Fortunately, the stone bed is very large, the stone room is like spring, and Nanyu simply sleeps in the Ruolan bed, even the Xianxian Don&rsquo;t go back, Sannan is sometimes lonely indoors. Seeing Yingqiong only to be true, not to be impressive and more happy. He refused to sleep first, and when he saw Li, Shen, and Qiu, he fell into his eyes and fell asleep. In his sleep, he heard Ying Qiong and Xianxian talking, and woke up and turned around. Ying Qiong first said to her, &ldquo;Your brother and Yang Chengzhi have been in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nan Gu was shocked. I heard Ying Qiong again said to Xianxian: &ldquo;On the day of this surname Yang stopped Zhixian, I couldn&rsquo;t say any reason. I always felt that he was not a peaceful thing. Mo Bu, which is the fault of their own fault. It is just that the ancestor of the ancestor of the Cui lotus is clearly saying that the fairy grass must wait for the teacher to arrange the arrangement of the teacher, and the disaster is disaster. Even we dare not act. If you are not at home, if the fairy grass is destroyed, how can the teacher be offending the sin? &quot;</p>
<p>Ruolan said:&rdquo; As far as I see, it is no wonder that Zhang Huer, he is young, what do you know? The most terrible thing is that Zhixian does not know where to go now. In case of being trapped and damaged at the same time, then it is bad! &quot;</p>
<p>Nanyu listened to the three -person tone and guessed that the tiger was seduced by Yang Chengzhi. Feng broke into the disaster, and did not know that Hu&rsquo;er&rsquo;s life and death were survived. Seeing that the three were frowning and angry, they didn&rsquo;t dare to ask, so anxiously tears, looking at the three of them straight. If Lan sees her poor, she said to her, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, do you do things alone, we don&rsquo;t blame you. Make your brother get up this morning and be seduced by Yang Chengzhi to steal the grass. Falling into the Ling Cui Peak. Now that Dan Terrace is shrouded in Yunyan, the two of him must be trapped. I barely reaches Dantai, and I have done what I have learned in the way. Xiewei. &quot;</p>
<p>Nan Gu couldn&rsquo;t help but ask about the matter, Ying Qiong rushed to say about it.</p>
<p>It turned out that Yang Chengzhi had been in his heart, and had been mentioned before.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after Danzhu Xiancao was discovered, everyone dare not move because of long eyebrows.</p>
<p>Yang Chengzhi thought to himself: &ldquo;Although the blood of Zhixian can be prolonged, everyone here is very strict and starts without authorization. Once you find it, you will not be willing to take a rest. When the people of the Qingluo came back, they dared to take the master of the teacher, and then dared to take it. Why not take advantage of this time and steal a few leaves to take it down. Because of the long time of Yu Jian, seeing his words and deeds on weekdays, he never dared to do this adventure with himself. In the past few days, I want to get the reality of Benshan from Nangu&rsquo;s mouth in the mouth of Tiger, and the same tiger children are quite close. I was still afraid that Hu&rsquo;er was often warned by Nan Gu, and dare not say clearly. He thought about a set of words. Being Yu Jian encouraged the tiger, and said that the ancient times came to become a fairy, all relying on the immortal fate. Sometimes Master gets the elixir fairy grass and has not taken it. He was stolen by his apprentice, and immediately became a immortal. Instead, the master could not fly. Now they find fairy grass, do not pick it up, and want to leave it to others. Want Tiger to help him steal. Tiger was also very smart, first remembered that the sister&rsquo;s words refused to go. Yang Chengzhi was very bad. He wanted to use him to involve risks, but he picked up his cheap; when he saw that he would not go, he was afraid that he would turn to Nan Gu, and the matter was revealed. &quot;</p>
<p>You are a fool. You think you can&rsquo;t even get in the hole of the Ling Cuifeng, how can you take it? I want you to go together because Shen Xiangu said that you have a good root. Can people who do not have a chance to write on the back of the back are not obedient? People who have no chance can be taken. Of course, if we have no chance, we go, but we only look at the aroma. There is a way to imagine, what are you afraid of? If you do n’t get a fate, if you miss the opportunity, you have to do it like an usual monk in the future, and you can do everything step by step to become a Tao. Okay! Besides, no one can conclude that there are many fairy grass in it, one is not missing. We stole it and eat it. Even if they know a few plants in the future, because there are a few plants in advance, it will be said that It is Zhixian to eat, and we will never be suspicious. Now we go to see the opportunity to see how our immortal fate is not strong. How to suffer from the empty learning of the way, can get the Ling Danxian grass before the monastery, and then stand up to become immortals. Learn them to fly around in the air. How can it be good? Hu&rsquo;er was very righteous, and his feelings were heavy. Although some of them were suspicious, Yang Chengzhi could not help but coax and forced demands, so he agreed. Yang Chengzhi got into the ruler and discussed the method of starting. Because of the small entrance, Zhixian could enter the grass, and there was a way. Knowing that Zhixian was often there, he decided to check the act of Zhixian first. When the people of the green snail did not come back, Li and Qiu would have to start in the past two days of Ruolan&rsquo;s injury.  On the same day, Yang Chengzhi deliberately and Yu Jianqi provoked his mouth, so that he could not do the way with him, pretending to play near Taiyuandong, and swim together with Huer. When I was far away from Jianjian, I drew a way with Hu&rsquo;er, followed the path in the cave, and went to Xianyin Sakan Terrace first. Only when I arrived at Dantai, I saw that Zhixian&rsquo;s only child was in front of Lingcui Peak. When he approached, he had no trace. He knew that Zhixian was the most spiritual, and I was afraid that it couldn&rsquo;t start. He watched it with Hu&rsquo;er. If he looked at it in front of the peak, he returned to Dantai and chose a place close to Ling Cuifeng. Tiger&rsquo;s spoken a few times was stopped by him, and only before he took his eyes to see the peak, Jing Guanzhixian came out. After a while, there was no movement. When I was about to be on the rest, I am afraid that Xianxian and Nan&rsquo;er sought them, so I had to come back first, and I will talk about it tomorrow morning. When I had to go to the circuit, I suddenly listened to the slight clearance of Ling Cuifeng. Yang Chengzhi was used together with the facial features. He kept paying attention from time to time. He hurriedly looked back, as if seeing the northeast corner of Ling Cuifeng moved slightly. Although I remember that place silently in my heart, the surface was still inadvertently walked away. Hu&rsquo;er asked where it was, and Yang Chengzhi said loudly, &ldquo;Presumably it must be from Zhixian, let&rsquo;s go, we can&rsquo;t surprise it, let everyone see a strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back to the room where Taiyuan Dong lived, Yu Jian sat in the room with his knees crossing his knees. Yang Chengzhi sneered and ignored him. Yu Jian took a while, and when he stayed with the interest, he still spoke with the two. He did not remember the corner of Shi Cai in his heart. Yang Chengzhi was always cold and ignorant. Tiger was nothing, and still joked. Yu Jian asked Hu&rsquo;er: &ldquo;Where is the talent and Brother Yang in? But haven&rsquo;t you been to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Huer did not answer, and Yang Chengzhi suddenly stood up: &ldquo;The rules here are strict. Take a look at Feiquan at Xianyao Ding. &quot;</p>
<p>Yu Jianwen said that because the two were standing at a high place when they left, they obviously watched them go around the embroidery clouds, knowing him to talk nonsense, and no longer asked. Unexpectedly, what was the difference between the two. The three of them were separated, and then rested.  Yang Chengzhi was lying on the stone couch. Calculating time, on the second day of the ugly ending, knowing that everyone would not come out. After listening to Jian and Hu&rsquo;er sleeping, they quietly awakened the tiger, and walked out of the cave lightly together. It should also be something. Yuan Xing has always hosted at the entrance of Dayuan Cave, and he is deeply spiritual. There are also god sculptures, which are even more eye -catching and keen. To be seen by it, Yang Chengzhi and Hu&rsquo;er are afraid that they will not be torn into two pieces by steel claws. I was ordered to keep the back hole in the past few days, and one was not followed. Yang Chengzhi took the tiger, and people slipped out of the hole without knowing it. Because of peeping at Shi Xian&rsquo;s movement, when he arrived in Xianyin San, he put his pace lightly. According to the booking idea, it is called Hu&rsquo;er to lurk under the northeast corner in front of Lingcui Peak from the Xianyin Sakura Forest. Her heron, he quietly copied it from Zhenglu, and slowly climbed up to Dan Ting to see, and did not see Zhixian. Looking at Huer&rsquo;er&rsquo;s secluded place to ambush before the peak, the two are far away. After waiting for a while, Zhixian moved. Zhengjue was a little disappointed, and suddenly smelled a fragrance. Take a closer look at the side of the cliffs on the side of Dantai. There are dozens of Cuishi that I saw yesterday. The joy was not far away, and he gently went to Dantai, picked all these dozen greens in his hands, ate two first, and hid the rest in his arms. I just walked to Dan Terrace, and suddenly saw that the grass flashed on the road, and a white Dongxi dangled in the grass. Take a closer look, it is Zhixian like a child, and jumped from the embroidery clouds to Dan Ting. After taking a few steps, I looked down at the ground, as if he had hesitated for a while, and jumped forward and walked forward. Yang Chengzhi was afraid of running it, and he didn&rsquo;t even dare to come out. For a while, Zhixian went to Dantai, and looked at the empty booing two times. Although the sound was not loud, the sound was clear and very pleasant. Then he faced the east, kneeling for a while, and got up to spit out a group of white gas, such as dozens of traces floating in the air, and sucked in again. For about half an hour, I didn&rsquo;t hesitate. I jumped off Dantai and walked to the peak. Going to the northeast corner of the peak, it seemed to predict that someone was ambushing on the side and couldn&rsquo;t help looking for Dong Xun and West. Yang Chengzhi didn&rsquo;t dare to neglect, and he had already mentioned his breath and covered it. Since the transplanting cave is blessed, the audience loves to protect it. Although she has forgotten the mind, it is sensitive. It came to the peak, smelled the breath of humanity, and was surprised in his heart. At a glance, he saw Hu&rsquo;er ambushing aside, and a shock &ldquo;Yeah&rdquo;</p>
<p>ran back to run back. When I turned around, I saw that the wicked people saw the wicked stretched out their hands and rushed up. The sacrifice of the long eyebrows near Lingfeng&rsquo;s long eyebrows can not be drilled in other places. When he was anxious, he rushed to the northeast peak corner in a panic, revealed a half of the emerald stone, and drilled inside. Tiger did not know the interests, rushed forward early, and dragged out of Zhixian&rsquo;s tender and white calf. That Zhixian earned two times and did not break away. He was held tightly by a tiger. He knew that he had been poisoned. He sprayed his mouth and sprayed a group of white gas and hit the face of the tiger. Essence Tiger was scared and shouted, &ldquo;Zhixian is powerful, come and gang a gang, I can&rsquo;t catch it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yang Chengzhi shouted, &ldquo;Brothers of the Tiger must not let go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Zhixian tied up. Then he said, &ldquo;If you want to exhale and escape, I will eat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Zhixian thought he was going to be in trouble, and he cried straight.
Huer didn&rsquo;t realize what happened before, and he caught Zhixian&rsquo;s hands, thinking of his sister&rsquo;s words, and saw Zhixian can&rsquo;t help wailing, couldn&rsquo;t help but be afraid, and couldn&rsquo;t bear it.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s put it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yang Chengzhi glanced at Hu&rsquo;er and said,&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get it, what do you know! &ldquo;Say, clamp Zhixian with one hand, take out the dozen Cui Shi, and say: &quot;</p>
<p>As long as you guide me how to pick that fairy grass, not only does it hurt you, but you also ask you to eat immortal fruit.&rdquo; That Zhixian was forced to helplessly, referring to the hole in the hole that fled in the right. Yang Chengzhi saw that the hole was full of tigers in and out, and even he could barely climb in, and couldn&rsquo;t help laughing: &quot;</p>
<p>As long as you enter the hole, can he get the fairy grass?&rdquo; Zhixian nodded with tears, and couldn&rsquo;t help looking at it. Following the tiger, he invited him to pity. Tiger looked at it was pitiful, and persuaded Yang Chengzhi to say: &quot;</p>
<p>We originally said that as long as we know the entrance of Cai Xiancao from Zhixian, now since I know it, it can’t speak, weird, let it go.&rdquo; Yang Cheng Zhi ignored him, and re -to Zhixian said: &quot;</p>
<p>People who can meet you for a long time can meet you. After that, Zhangkou would bite on Zhixian&rsquo;s arm. Shi Xian&rsquo;s boldness flew, and couldn&rsquo;t live in Yang Chengzhi&rsquo;s hand. Tiger learned that Yang Chengzhi&rsquo;s Dang was not good at this time. At this time, he couldn&rsquo;t speak with him. He grabbed Zhixian, and threw it out regardless of the green soap and white. Zhixian Ben is a spiritual material. He takes off his hand. Although he has a silk tied, he throws it out with a tiger. Somehow, rolling around, breaking the tie all the way, loud, like flying away.  Yang Chengzhi ate tiger and couldn&rsquo;t prevent this punch, and he hit the two temples of Venus. Tiger was afraid that he would go to chasing Zhixian. He had taken advantage of the situation, and the two fluttered at the same time, twisted into a ball, and rolled on the ground. It wasn&rsquo;t until Zhixian&rsquo;s running was not shadow. Yang Chengzhi broke away. He didn&rsquo;t expect that Hu&rsquo;er was born with this brute force. He had not eaten the blood, and he ate this big loss and hated the tiger into the bone marrow. It was just that he was treacherous and knew that if he turned his face, not only could he not eat lamb, but he had to make trouble. When I moved in my heart, I had a gangster, but conquered the anger, and said with a smile: &ldquo;Good brother, what are you? How dare I do? I saw that the hole was too small. Its livelihood. You see you like this as this. Now that Zhixian has gone, you can&rsquo;t think about it, you have to try it into the hole. If you don’t have the fairy grass, you have to count the two blessings. 。好在这事已做到这般地步，芝仙不会人言，虽不怕它告状，须防它去引了人来，还不下手，等待何时？」虎儿到底年幼，见杨Cheng Zhi was swollen by his nose and eyes. Then he replied: &quot;</p>
<p>Brother Yang was blamed for me. Since I misunderstood it, please forgive me for being young. I promised you yesterday. Xian, I just listen to your greeting. &quot;  Yang Chengzhi looked at the entrance of the cave, so he asked Hu&rsquo;er to go in first to see the reality inside. Tiger&rsquo;s words were drilled in, and I saw that the red and green light in the darkness flashed in the darkness, and when I heard Qixiang in the nose, I was always empty. I was afraid of my heart and did not dare to go deep, so I told Yang Chengzhi. Yang Chengzhi scolded his stupidity, fearing that Zhi Xian reported his letter, he changed his life late. He tried himself at the entrance of the cave. As soon as he arrived, he didn&rsquo;t want Huer to do it first, and was afraid that he would not be omitted by himself. Yang Chengzhi was anxious, and he went to the southwest corner alone. Huer was behind him, and he was fluttering with the red and green light with his hands, and he was beaten by the mud block behind his head. Looking back, Zhixian was beckoning at the entrance of the cave. I felt strange, and when he called Yang Chengzhi, he saw Zhixian shook his hand towards him. Tiger&rsquo;s heart moved, thinking, &quot;</p>
<p>Must Yang Chengzhi has no immortal, Zhixian is grateful, do you come to point out the fairy grass?&rdquo; When he was thinking, seeing Zhixian beckoned him to go out, and then he took his fingers to the tiger. north. Tiger thought that there was a fairy grass where Zhixian referred to, so he walked as it was. I just came, and listened to Zhixian again, and it was full of frightened colors. Hu&rsquo;er was wondering and listened to Yang Chengzhi exclaimed. When Hu&rsquo;er quickly looked back, he saw a golden light, and there were five -colored smoke clouds. In the golden light, Yang Chengzhi was like a magic. Tiger&rsquo;s younger heart and boldness, I do n’t know if I do n’t know. When I want to go up and watch, my body has been surrounded by smoke and clouds. , Entry neither, retreat nor cannot be. Then I was anxious to scare, shouting two times Yang Chengzhi, and did not agree. Suddenly, the clouds and clouds became more and more dense, and they tightly wrapped the tiger, and immediately became cold and bones. The limbs of the facial features were completely lost.  Yu Jian had been alert. Because of the corner of the day and Yang Chengzhi, he ate him and sneered at night. He remembered that he was lonely and hard -working. It is just that he has not officially worshiped the teacher. Most of the fairy heroes here are women. They may not be able to return to the door. The future is vast and difficult to reverse. He always thought that Yang Chengzhi was a friendship of life and death, but unexpectedly he was so engraved. If he was generally knowledgeable with him, he may be despised by the fairy heroes, and everything could only be reversed. Sadly sorrowful, I haven&rsquo;t fallen asleep for a long time. Later, I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>Everything is there, you can enter the Immortal Mansion, and it is definitely not accidental. What is the rest to control others? Think of these noses? &ldquo;When he was flat, he fell asleep. In his sleep, he seemed to hear a footsteps. He opened his eyes slightly. Seeing that Yang Chengzhi led the tiger, he walked out of the room lightly. Knowing that the two of him avoided himself, he pretended not to know. After the two left, they remembered that Yang Chengzhong had a good relationship with himself, and he had narrated the Life and Death Oral League. He suddenly used to find things to turn his face with himself yesterday. Tiger a child, but he is particularly good to him, and many of them are all contrived in the middle. The more you think, the more he feels that they are suspicious. Thinking of Nan Gu once said that listening to Qiu Xiangu said that this is not only a blessed land, but also a strange flower everywhere, the fairy medicine and grass. Although Xian Xia has lived here for a long time, before he taught the real person in the future, everyone could not completely point out the name. Except for several kinds of different fruits, many unknown fairy grass dare not move, and maybe to prevent without damage to heaven and earth treasures. Therefore, I have repeatedly ordered the four people to come. If they are not ordered, they can only watch at will. Mo Feiyang and Zhang have met Xiancao elixir and the like. The two of him had an adventure and he was not jealous. It is just that their behavior is like theft. If the two Xiangu, Li and Shen, can we forgive it? He couldn&rsquo;t help but take care of his two, refused to sit down, and decided to go to find them.  At the moment, he walked out of Taiyuan Cave. Because he saw the two detoured to the embroidered cloud yesterday, he chased towards the embroidery clouds. After this careful thought, it has been delayed. I found it in the embroidery clouds, where there are two people. Knowing that there are many fairy scenery in Quanya, the place is big, it is not easy to find, you have to go to the cliff and want to look at it from a high place. Only when I arrived at the top of the cliff, I saw that the white clouds on the side of Xianyin Saka were filled with the white clouds, and the colorful smoke was shrouded. Can&rsquo;t help but like to dance. I thought that such a heavy fog was hidden even if the Spirit Cuifeng was hidden. The suspicion was that there was treasures to light up. Fortunately, not far apart, I ran away and wanted to see what happened. Only after the colorful cloud was ten feet, I felt that Xiang Xiang was shining, and he was shining with eyes. After taking a few steps forward, not only Jin Guangcai shot his eyes pain, he also felt that he was cold, trembling, dare not make it, and returned. It is estimated that the two will never be here. They always remember the accident, and they dare not stay more, and they choose to go on the circuit.
Gradually walked under the Guangya cliffs of Tongfei Thunder Cave, and then remembered that shortly after the first time, Qiu Xiangu and Yuan Xing found the cave on the cliff in the unintentional heart, each had a sip of a fairy sword.</p>
<p>At that time, Yang Chengzhi was very hot.</p>
<p>Do not divide?</p>
<p>The cliff stood thousands of feet, and it was very dangerous.</p>
<p>Yang Chengzhi practiced martial arts when he was young, and even though he was barely able to go up, Hu&rsquo;er couldn&rsquo;t go up.</p>
<p>There are also god sculptures and Yuan Xing who can&rsquo;t tolerate the two of them, and they feel wrong.</p>
<p>Because you can&rsquo;t see him everywhere, you have been in the industry for two hours.</p>
<p>After a while, when Xianxian greeted everyone to eat, he had to try it up.</p>
<p>Who knows that although the cliff is full of vinelian grass, he can climb, but it is as smooth as oil under his feet.</p>
<p>Before I went to the mountainside entrance, I only went to ten times, and I felt exhausted.</p>
<p>The more he guess he couldn&rsquo;t go up, he planned to go.</p>
<p>Slightly sparse, grabbed the air in one hand, and rolled down.</p>
<p>Although Manchus does not die, it is necessary to bring a little injury.</p>
<p>Looking at it, there were two or three feet away from the ground, and suddenly a bunch of mountain stones put his waist back.</p>
<p>Yu Jian had a negative pain, and couldn&rsquo;t help but twitch his waist and slipped his head upwards.</p>
<p>I was secretly happy in my heart, my feet were on the ground, or they could not be injured.</p>
<p>In this blink of an eye, I felt like her feet hit a big stone again, hitting the heel and pain.</p>
<p>The rocks had four or five feet to see squares, as if they were floating, and they did not take root on the cliff wall.</p>
<p>She was bumped off the body by Yu Jianyi and rolled down.</p>
<p>Yu Jian was shocked, and his feet guarded his body immediately, punching a punch, and felt that his feet were implemented in a coma.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was on the ground, and I was shocked.</p>
<p>When I looked down, the mountain stone was actually a small cave.</p>
<p>I just stood in the cave, and there was still one foot seven or eight feet away from below.</p>
<p>Although it is not high from top to bottom, it is not the first time that it was put on the place by Shanshi for the first time, not when it came up.</p>
<p>The rock wall under this small hole shrinks into it, forming a convex and concave.</p>
<p>Except for standing at the entrance of the cave, jumping down from one seven or eight feet high, I can&rsquo;t even run down.</p>
<p>Essence After a while, I couldn&rsquo;t look down in the hurry.</p>
<p>The hole had three feet to see the square, and the cave entrance was blue stone on all sides, and it was like jade.</p>
<p>It is not dirt standing under the feet, but a bluestone slab, full of scriptures on it.</p>
<p>A thin seam in the center, on the other side of the recessed crescent, with a plate of rings in the crescent.</p>
