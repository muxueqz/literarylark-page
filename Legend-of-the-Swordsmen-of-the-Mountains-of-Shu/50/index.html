    <h1>Forty -nine times, the bears met the stone pearls to capture the tiger to meet the ghost Taoist priests</h1>
    <p>Forty -nine times, the bears met the stone pearls to capture the tiger to meet the ghost Taoist priests  At this time, except for the old orangutan still beside Yingqiong, the orangutan and bear had escaped.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong hated the woman in white to kill the creatures for no reason, and fantasized the air in the air; if she couldn&rsquo;t fight, she looked up at the air: &ldquo;Bold and cheap! Kill my orangutan and bear without any reason, do you dare to fight me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words are still right, and there is a flash of electricity in front of the eyes. The woman in white has landed, standing in front of Yingqiong, about a few feet far and near, and said with a smile: &ldquo;This sister should not curse. Send my sister Shen Ruolan back to Yunnan Guihua Mountain to refine the sword, passing the mountain, and hearing the drums. Seeing the independent peak of the sister, surrounded by the monster with many horses, it was suspected that the sister mountain was in danger. Farly, I am afraid that the rescue will not be available, so I will release the flying sword. Originally, I did n’t want to hurt the strange beast raised by my sister. At a young age, there is such a prestige of the beast. The sword light emitted by the talent is ten times stronger than the flying sword, and the girl can not recognize which sect. Sisters are merciless, and almost the girl has been destroyed in Wudang Mountain in the 20th year of Wudang Mountain. Once the surname is the name of the surname? Who is the teacher? Do you practice in this mountain? Please explain one by one.  Seeing that the woman in white was about twenty, Ying Qiong, Yingzhong, talked about vomiting, and had the ability to fly, and had already seen it at first sight. Until he heard her talk, I realized that it was a beauty, and this misunderstanding happened. I wanted to tell her the truth, because I often heard Li Ning saying that people were unpredictable. Since she praised this sword, she was stronger than her flying sword. In case of telling the truth, she got up and came to seize. , I have no skills, how to resist the enemy? She was afraid of this sword, simply coaxing her, and then seeing Jing Shengqing, and to tell the truth. After the idea was determined, first put the sword into the sheath, and then laughed recently: &quot;</p>
<p>Girl Li Yingqiong, Monter Bai Mei Monk. I came here to travel from Emei for a while, and I was happy for a while. My sister was kind, offending words, and looking at my sister forgiveness. This sword is called Zi Yan, and it is also given by the ancestor. Who is the sister? ? &quot;  Shi Mingzhu heard the words of surprise: &quot;</p>
<p>It turns out that the sister is the ancestor of Bai Mei, and no wonder there is this amazing ability. The family teacher is the half -side of Wudang Mountain. After the girl returns to the mountain, she will visit Emei. The sister If you have time, you can also travel to Wudang, and the sister will lead the sister to see the family teacher. With the natural heterogeneity of sisters, the family teacher meets, and must be happy. , Do you have a real thing about the old things? Hearing that this sword has been used to be a real -bearing -to -the -eye, the faint place where there is a deep mountain with a spell, except for the emperor of Emei to teach the ancestors of the Qiankun, no one knows the address. At that time The person of this sword is a person who inherits the reality of the real human Taoism. How can the sister under the door of the white eyebrows? It is puzzling. The sister&rsquo;s income is really a real thing for the old eyebrows. Maybe Sister Rong is looking at? &quot;  Ying Qiong Shi was afraid that people would watch her sword. I didn&rsquo;t know her mind, and she really watched it. Although unwilling in my heart, I was embarrassed to agree. Looking at the pearl&rsquo;s words, it is not like there is any hypocrisy. He had to boldly put the sword in front of him: &quot;</p>
<p>How do you ask your sister to watch this sword?&rdquo; The pearl was gently pulled out in Yingqiong&rsquo;s hands, and the purple light flashed next to the sun, and the sword had out of the box. This sword is really amazing. In the season, it is also purple -light and air -conditioned, but it does not seem to have the light of Changhong when it is on the enemy. Shi Mingzhu took the sword in his hand, looked at it and looked, and said, &quot;</p>
<p>This sword is attributed to the sister, it can be described as the winner.&quot; He was praised in a row, and suddenly looked at Ying Qiong&rsquo;s face carefully. He repeatedly played the sword for a while. Xiao Qiong said to Yingqiong, &quot;</p>
<p>Although I think this sword is a Qibao, the sister&rsquo;s own aura has not been transported on it, and it is united with its sword. Isn&rsquo;t the sister who has won this sword, not now?&quot; When Yingqiong saw her suddenly asking, she couldn&rsquo;t help but be taken aback; she also saw that the Pearl&rsquo;s hand could not help showing the sword, and did not pay back. There was a lot of love. She can see that she cannot be in one sword, and her capable Nihiro has been seen by her. In case she is forced, isn&rsquo;t it a opponent? How can it be good? Before others expressed any maliciousness, it was inconvenient to turn his face to pay back. It ’s difficult to be born, so anxious to blushing, I do n’t know what to use to answer people, and it’ s extremely anxious. I can&rsquo;t help but wish in my heart, &quot;</p>
<p>My Zi Gao Sword, come back soon! Don&rsquo;t let others grab it!&quot; I just thought about it. The ground took off the control of Shi Mingzhu, flew directly beside Ying Qiong, and said automatically, and automatically returned to the box. Xitin Yingqiong was beating in his heart, but he did not dare to appear in words, but made some reserved spirit.  When Shi Mingzhu saw Ying Qiong&rsquo;s young age, he was in a fairy bone, and he got a real purple sword with long eyebrows. He loved and envious. I accidentally saw that there was no attachment to the aura on the sword, and secretly surprised that Ying Qiong came to this person alone. How did the beasts come out? Originally, I wanted to ask Ming Qing, and I planned for Yingqiong. What I said was a good intention. Who wants Ying Qiong to hear the words, groaning, and suddenly retracted the sword again, thinking that blame her to see people, and secretly took the sword back with the real gas. However, she didn&rsquo;t know the sword spirit, and she wished in secret with Ying Qiong. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>This is not a sword that combines the sword with the true Qi of the Five Elements, but can be suck back with the Qi. I have learned the sword for more than 20 years, and I have no ability.&quot; Perspective. Seeing Ying Qiong stared at a pair of beautiful eyes, looking at himself without saying a word. In Yingqiong because of his own layman, I am afraid that he said something wrong, and he was seen by people. It would be better to say that it would be less, and it would be better to say that it was better to say that Shi Mingzhu was perfunctory. Where does Shi Mingzhu know? It is also that Ying Qiong should not be attributed to the Wudang faction, so that each other has this misunderstanding. Shi Mingzhu saw Ying Qiong&rsquo;s sorrow, and he couldn&rsquo;t do it for a long time. He had to say, &quot;</p>
<p>The girl is wrong, but fortunately, don&rsquo;t see it. Now I still have to return to the mountains. I want to save it.&quot; Ying Qiong sees that she is going to leave. , Ru Di burdened. Busy: &quot;</p>
<p>Sister is beautiful, very heart -hearted. I am still a bit delayed here. My sister wants to visit Emei, and go again in the second half of the year.&quot; Mingzhu doubted that Ying Qiong expressed his rejection, and it was unhappy. He snorted unsurprisingly, and his feet were slightly settled, breaking the air.  After Ying Qiongmu sent the pearl, he thought of: &quot;</p>
<p>I want to have a female sword fairy as Master, how to meet the sword fairy by himself and missed it in person? Big. Hate you want to meet the opportunity, and if you say nothing, you do n’t know what to talk about, and miss her in person. &ldquo;When he called in person, he called in the clouds, and he was no longer going to go. No matter what, he resent for a while, and when he saw that the red day was empty, the sky was clear, so he had to prepare on the road.  As soon as those orangutan and bear saw the pearl, they gathered again. Ying Qiong said to them, &quot;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m leaving. I think Er and other are beasts, but they are also psychic. In the deep mountains, many things you eat, after I leave, do not hurt people anymore. I am. If you visit the famous teacher, you can learn the swordsmanship, and from time to time, you have to visit Er Er from time to time. Essence Ying Qiong asked the old orangutan and said, &ldquo;Waiting for this roar, is there any monster in the mountains, do you want me to remove them on behalf of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gorilla shook his head. Ying Qiong knew that it was grateful, and couldn&rsquo;t help but have some love in his heart, and said, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to wait. I really don&rsquo;t go back, my brother Jinyan returns to Emei. Human nature, what she knew what she said, still surrounded. I want to get out of the sword to scare them, and I am afraid of injury. I can&rsquo;t bear it. I had to scream according to the sword Jiao: &quot;</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t let the way, I will use the sword to hurt the life.&rdquo; There are about half a box out of the sword, and the purple light is sparkling. Those orangutan and Xiong Guo were scared, and they drew up one by one.  Ying Qiong&rsquo;s whole body was wrapped, exercised lightly, and walked forward. Those oranges and bears also reluctantly followed behind, sending about two or thirty miles of mountain roads. Along the way, there were a lot of water streams, and they all passed by relying on their skills. When I walked to the beginning of the beginning of Shen, I went to a peak, looking at the peach willow forest under the mountain, as if they were faintly present, knowing that it was not far from the village city. I brought this group of strange beasts myself, I am afraid that it was scared and many inconvenient. Then he turned back to the orangutan and bear: &quot;</p>
<p>Sending a thousand miles, you have to leave one after another. If you go back this time, if you can practice swordsmanship, you will often come to visit Er. This mountain goes down. Wait for thousands of in groups to follow behind, don&rsquo;t you scare the residents of the mountains? Come back to the mountains and lurk it. &quot; No. The old orangutan walked into the oranges, roaring twice, and many orangutan gave a lot of strange results. When Ying Qiong saw it, she was so affectionate, she ate casually, and took some pine nuts, yellow essence, etc., and put it inside the baggage. Then the gorilla took the remaining fruit products and picked it in his hand.
Ying Qiong didn&rsquo;t pay much attention.</p>
<p>Seeing those orangutans and bears no longer followed, she moved forward since she took this peak.</p>
<p>After walking halfway, looking back at the peak head, those oranges and bears were still far away.</p>
<p>The gorilla followed him behind him, and only Xu Yuan and near.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong felt strange, so he greeted it and asked, &ldquo;Your companions have gone back, what do you always follow me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were not yet, and when I saw it, I still held the fruits I took in the hands of the group. I feel that the livestock is loyal than people, and I can&rsquo;t help but feel that you are because you are not satisfied with the fruit that you send me because you give me the fruit like you have sent me a similar kind? I can&rsquo;t get it. The orangutan shook his head, put the fruit on a stone, pointed at Ying Qiong with his hands, pointed at it himself, and pointed forward again. Ying Qiong realized that a few words in the cave a few days ago were recognized by it and wanted to return to Mount Emei with himself. Then asked it, &ldquo;Do you want to go back with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The orangutan grabbed his ears and scratched his cheeks for a while, and suddenly a word said, Xue Yingqiong said, &ldquo;Go back with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leader, early human nature. Kana Nikko Qiong gave it a pool of Ho Shouwu. In the past few days, the horizontal bones gradually became more and more psychic. Knowing that if you can return to the mountain with the owner, it will be good in the future. So he decided to abuse his descendants&rsquo; homes and go to Emei. It also knows that Yingqiong may not be allowed, so he did not dare to be behind. As soon as Ying Qiong saw it, he shouted to ask him, and he got along with Ying Qiong for a long time, and he had said that he couldn&rsquo;t say anything in his heart. At this time, when he was anxious, he stretched his neck bones, and he actually made a rhetoric. Its ancestors were originally spoken. It was born of the orangutan&rsquo;s father and mother. Now that the elixir is reborn, it will not be difficult to talk about people at the beginning. This is not a word.  Ying Qiong saw it for three days to learn from the words, so he liked it. I wanted to take it back. Then he said to it: &ldquo;Your meaning is very good. Besides, you are smart. You can learn from me for a few days, walk with me, and be useful for me. Helpless with you, it&rsquo;s inconvenient to go along the way. When you meet a famous teacher, learn to become swordsmanship, how about you? &quot;</p>
<p>The orangutan heard the words, saying&rdquo; I go, you go, pick red fruits. &quot;</p>
<p>When Ying Qiong saw it, he was very anxious and sincere , Love and pity, can&rsquo;t bear to wipe out its sincerity. In the end, the childlike heart has not retreated, and there is no companionship in the mountains, and when someone is where someone is, he will compare it, and then say, &ldquo;I don’t want you to go with You were born fiercely. In case of being seen, it was either frightened by you, or to think of you. Monster harms you, I can kill it; people want to harm you, I can&rsquo;t do it. As I get to others, try it first. If you get through, you will go with me, otherwise you will only wait for the future. &quot;</p>
<p>When the orangutan heard the words, he bowed his head for a while and nodded. Ying Qiong was happy and walked forward, feeling a little thirsty. Seeing that there was a mountain stream in front, the spring water was clear, so he took a lot of water and drank with a little water. The orangutan was also holding one hand of pine nuts and the like. He put down his hands, put down his fruits in his hand, and learned the appearance of Yingqiong. How can the two fingers miss, and the unlike human fingers, it is equivalent to holding the water to the mouth, and the karma has been exhausted. After holding a few times, I never got a drop. Recruiting Yingqiong laughed. It was still the orangutan&rsquo;s branches beside the branches and stretched his head into the water before drinking it. He remembered the fruits placed next to the stone, holding it in his hand. Yingqiong was very beautiful and delicious because of the pine fruit fruit along the road, and was not in Emei. Since the cave left, ten miles away, she never met like that good. So I was reluctant to eat it, and I wanted to go back to Zhu Guo, waiting for her only guest Yu Yingnan. However, I did not expect that this reckless Cangshan, among the mountains of Yunnan, has taken thousands of miles in the Wan Mountain in Yunnan, and I do n’t know how many days to go. If it wasn&rsquo;t for Lu Yu Xianyuan, I am afraid that I hadn&rsquo;t returned to Emei, and it would be rotten.  Ying Qiong only picked a few pine nuts in the hands of the orangutan, and opened his own parcel again to fill the fruits. One orangutan and one person, just on his body, suddenly a burst of storms, rolled stone flying sand. The orangutan sniffed two sniffs, a long howl, and the vertical body, and it was on a big tree that was ten feet away from the front. Seeing that the style was strange, Ying Qiong shocked the orangutan on the tree. She was surprised. Suddenly, many apes and deer rabbits were ran down on the hillside opposite. In the back of the wind, a white -eyed white tiger, with yellow hair, was very fierce and dull, yelled, and the two or three jumps were not far from the trees in the orangutan. Although Ying Qiong cuts the monsters day by day, like such a fierce tiger has been seen for the first time in his life. When you are about to pull forward, the tiger has only a dozen feet away from Ying Qiongli. At a glance, he saw a born person, and immediately squatted his body and initiated the vowel: circle two yellow light eyes, opened the big mouth, opened the big mouth, and opened his mouth. , Revealing the four big teeth of the upper and lower Bai Sen, a seven or eight -foot tiger tail, hit the ground, and the dust was flying. Suddenly shaking the yellow hair on his body, making a posture. As soon as he was about to go up, he was taken away by the two steel claws on the tree on the tree. When he mentioned it up, he lifted the tiger up and five or six feet away from the ground. The tiger was unintentionally calculated, roaring, and desperately wanted to break away from the orangutan&rsquo;s paw. The orangutan is even more cunning. It holds both feet tightly branches, holding the tiger scalp with both hands, and hitting the tiger&rsquo;s head directly on the tree that can be two or three hugs. Although the tiger is strong, it is suspended because of his strength. No exhibition. When the orangutan hit it, it screamed. Just hit the tree and swayed, and the power of the branches rang. Seeing that the orangutan captured the tiger, Yingqiong felt fun and hit it, and did not step forward to help kill the tiger. After a while, the tiger was quite strong and never killed. The orangutan is much taller than the person. In addition, the weight of this hanging eye white tiger is more than six or seven hundred pounds. Although the horizontal branches of the tree can be affordable. The orangutan hit it high, one made the power fierce, the card was stunned, the branches were broken, and the tiger&rsquo;s back was ride. The tiger was hit by the orangutan for a while, his head was dizzy, and it was easy to fall to the ground. He was tightly tightened by the orangutan. It was very painful. Fly.  Ying Qiong was in a hurry to exercise and kung fu in a hurry. After chasing the two hillsides, chasing behind a rock wall, I heard a scream of the orangutan, knowing not good, hurriedly chased the past. Seeing that the orangutan industry fell to the ground, the tiger&rsquo;s front paw pounced on the chest of the orangutan, couldn&rsquo;t hold his teeth and shake his tail, and yelled. There was a red -faced man standing next to him, holding his hands. Seeing that the orangutan was under the tiger&rsquo;s mouth, he was very dangerous. He regarded the blue and red soap and white, and went forward. He waved his sword in his hand, and the ten -long purple light passed, and his big tiger head immediately cut it down. At first sight, the red -faced man saw the purple light from Ying Qiong&rsquo;s hand, and was surprised, and he was busy returning his body. Asked, &ldquo;Where did the bold female doll come from? Dare to wound the god tiger who guarded my guardian in Xianfu?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said, he pointed at Ying Qiong in his hands. Ying Qiong immediately felt dizzy, busy, but fortunately fell down. The man was the ghost of the ghost of the Yin Yang of the Wushan God, the ghost and the ghost, and the ghost Taoist, and he also learned a magic swordsmanship like Yin and Yang, which is more evil than Yin and Yang. The white tiger was his insistence. He went out to hunt today and met Ying Qiong. The tiger was also quite spiritual. He was catching up with the Luolu wild rabbit. Suddenly, he saw a beautiful female baby standing in front, so she wanted to go back and supplements with its owner according to the habit of the past. I didn&rsquo;t want to hit the orangutan&rsquo;s secret calculation. After falling to the ground, the orangutan was tightly stubbornly stubborn. That Qiao&rsquo;s thin Tengwen did not seem to be in the past. He knew that the tiger would meet a strong enemy and was about to save. The tiger had returned with the orangutan. The tiger also suffered a lot of pain, and hit a while on the tree, dizzy, and fluttered on the orangutan&rsquo;s chest with both claws. He originally planned to relieve his breath and bite to take revenge. Who wants to be rushed by Ying Qiong, and Yijian will be different.  Qiao Shou Teng didn&rsquo;t know that someone was chasing behind the tiger, and the person who saw the coming was a beautiful girl. He didn&rsquo;t take it in heart and didn&rsquo;t know it was the owner. Turn off a bad heart, want to capture the cave, and use it. Who thinks that the girl is very powerful, just take a look, and in the blink of an eye, she sent out a dozen Changhong -like purple light, killing his beloved tiger, and was furious. I thought it was still used to turn the girl with the method of turning the fairy. Who knows that Fuchen refers to the past, the girl is not conscious, so that the comer is not an ordinary generation. Looking at the girl, it seems that she is looking for the obscurity. However, he didn&rsquo;t know that Ying Qiong had a lot of elixir Zhu Guo, and was easily invaded by ordinary demon methods. I was thinking in my heart, and suddenly listened to the girl from the opposite side and said, &ldquo;Which temple Taoist is you? I dare to hurt the tiger! My orangutan was already winning, and now I fell to the ground. The harm. When I see, if you have been counted, I will never take a rest with you. &quot;</p>
<p>While saying, walking into the place where the orangutan was lying. Although Qiao San Teng saw that the person was young, the sword light sent out for a while was no different from the male and female sword used by the real people in the past, and he could raise such a large orangutan. Listening to Ying Qiong said, it is naive, unlike to look for his own obscure and relax. Knowing that this woman was unknown, she secretly thought about her words. She first blocked the Shili Mountain Road around her with the Xuan Girl of the Demon Fa to prevent escape. I don&rsquo;t say it, sit down on a stone on the side of the road, and see how the girl is applied to save the orangutan.
At this time, Ying Qiong had approached the orangutan, seeing it lying on the ground, his face wrinkled, his eyes were crying, and his anger was very painful.</p>
<p>Seeing Yingqiong, he barely sat up and compared his hand with his hands, but he couldn&rsquo;t speak in his mouth.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong is good at borrowing, seeing the orangutan&rsquo;s hand, knowing that the Taoist couples, I can&rsquo;t help but scold: &ldquo;Good thief! You can&rsquo;t speak by you. I&rsquo;ll calculate it with you again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ying Ying! &ldquo;Ying Qiong saw the orangutan&rsquo;s throat with his throat, suspected that it was thirsty, so he couldn&rsquo;t speak. Now unbuttoning the package, in addition to pine nuts and yellow essence, there are dozens of leftover Zhuguo, which takes two to take two, stuffed in the orangutan mouth. The more he wanted to hate, he stood up and pointed at Qiao San Teng and scolded: &quot;</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t say people who can&rsquo;t speak my orangutan. Go, ask you to do the dumb of the one. &quot; That Qiao San Teng did not know that the orangutan had taken elixir. When Ying Qiong approached, the orangutan could sit up and saw Ying Qiong took out Zhu Guo and orangutan to eat, and became more shocked. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>This little girl&rsquo;s origin must not be small. It seems that Zhu Guo, who has rare encounters for a hundred years, actually uses it to feed orangutans casually. Don&rsquo;t say that you can see it in the first time, and you haven&rsquo;t heard it.&rdquo; See Ying Qiong towards him Surgery, anger in my heart, and sneered, &quot;</p>
<p>Who is your little girl, who is the disciple, running to me to disturb? I have got off the Tianluo Diwang, and you can&rsquo;t escape your wings. The house is happy. &quot;  The words were not enough. The underground orangutan ate Zhu Guo, and he had returned to the beginning. Qiao Shi Teng was too late to guard, and was caught by the two steel claws of the orangutan. He couldn&rsquo;t shout in the pain. There were many demon methods in empty. He couldn&rsquo;t show it. Still Yingqiong didn&rsquo;t know that this person was a demon who was not evil. I am afraid that he had killed people. Then the orangutan listened to work, and his hands were loose, and he returned to Ying Qiong. Seeing the orangutan letting go, Qiao San Teng was lucky enough to keep his life. He had eaten such a big loss in his life. He was furious in his heart. Ying Qiong saw the momentum, and pulled the sword forward, and the purple light of Changhong welcomed the enemy&rsquo;s flying sword. Qiao&rsquo;s skinny knee was not good. He hurriedly retracted the flying sword. He had been cut off by Ying Qiong and fell to the ground.  When Ying Qiong welcomed the enemy, he thought, &quot;</p>
<p>This thief will fly swords.&rdquo; He couldn&rsquo;t help but panic. Whoever wants Ziguang to go out, he will repel the enemy and be happy in his heart. The orangutan beside that suddenly shouted &quot;</p>
<p>Monster&rdquo; and &quot;</p>
<p>Flying Sword&rdquo; loudly. Ying Qiong thought: &quot;</p>
<p>This thief is different. Such a big tiger said that he was raised by his family. This orangutan is quite spiritual. Is he really a monster?&quot; Waiting for the sword to come forward and hearing the opposite Taoist Scolded: &quot;</p>
<p>Bold girl! Dare to hurt me to fly swords. You have entered my Tianluo.com, not surrendered, and he entered the hole to make fun, died to the end, and regret it!&quot; Although Ying Qiong did not know what he said, estimated It&rsquo;s not good, scolding, &quot;</p>
<p>The monster takes away, eat me a sword!&quot; The ghost Taoist Qiao Shi Teng saw the purple light opposite, just like Changhong flew, knowing that it was difficult to welcome the enemy, he thought of words in his mouth, and looked at the air in his hands, and immediately went away. Ying Qiong chased the Taoist where he was standing, and suddenly the Taoist trace disappeared, and he was surprised. Looking at the sky, it was the intersection of Shen Yi. Before the dusk, seeing this person invisible during the day, the more suspicious it was a ghost. Because the Taoist talents have already set up Tian Luo Di.com, they took a closer look at it with their eyes. Four ancient Mumatse, the sunlight shot into the forest thin, with a gray color, the fruit was a little ghost. Knowing that Jiu Li must be dangerous, no intention of investigating Taoism. It was waiting to return to the original road. Suddenly a whirlwind passed, rolled the underground sand and gravel a few feet high, just like countless roots pillars, rotating.</p>
