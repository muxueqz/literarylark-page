<p>He actually refined his soul ten times stronger than the borrowing body.</p>
<p>This treasure has knew the mysteries, and he couldn&rsquo;t help him.</p>
<p>Lin Han lived in the middle of the puppet, and learned Zen merit, and Fang started back.</p>
<p>Yang Jin was not in the 只 at this time, but she went to the mountain with the master before and saw several times.</p>
<p>He once heard the master say that he has everything to ask himself.</p>
<p>Knowing that he couldn&rsquo;t come, he was waiting before the tent, and he looked forward to his expression.</p>
<p>Maybe he was waiting for himself to return to the 庵.</p>
<p>He was busy greeted Yunfeng, took four primary schools, and descended together.</p>
<p>It turned out that Lin Han still came here for help.</p>
<p>Master Fen Tuo was meditating, only saying: &ldquo;Yang Jin can be conspired. At present, Ling Yunfeng is with Ling Yunfeng. Lin Han did not dare to read it by the side, and what he asked was extremely urgent, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but run out of his hoe.  I was waiting a little bit, and I was very happy to meet. Yang Jin quoted Yunfeng and Four Primary School, and Shi Li entered the 庵. Go in front of Master Fen Tuo, lead Yunfeng and the four primary schools to worship together. The fetus, together with the three branches of the demon tomb, shot the Yangshen crossbow, forty -nine iron beans, a big gourd, etc., and presented to the seat, respectfully, and complained about everything. The master opened his eyes, with a smile of laughter, glanced at Lin Han, signaled to withdraw, and closed his eyes again. Yang Jin felt that Master was sitting in today&rsquo;s meditation expression without the same time. The treasures have been presented, and only the god dove is fierce, and he dare not care about it. He just wants to use Zhu Huan to escort it outside the temple and give it to Yunfeng to guard. The god dove was captured by the enemy, and he was unconvinced, and he had long been ready to go. At the time of the coming, Yang and Ling daughter heard that the two old veterans were heard, they knew that it was difficult to make, and even the treasures they were carrying all went on to prevent it from seeing things and thinking, and they were not subject to restraint. It was also trusted by the second old age, intending to surrender, and it was inconvenient to hurt it. When I entered the worship, I presented the treasures, and the Dove saw that it was the old master, and suddenly fell into the enemy. When Yang Jin was going to escort it to the outer hall, he couldn&rsquo;t help it. There are Zhu Huan Shenguang, and the whole body is circled. Although he can&rsquo;t make it, he is so powerful and fierce and stubborn, but it also looks amazing. Yang Jin drank: &quot;</p>
<p>The evil animal, dare to be so bold!&rdquo; Take out the Fahua Golden Wheel, Fang wants to force it to make Fan, Master Fen Tuo&rsquo;s hand, suddenly take off his wrist and turn it into ten feet long. Rainbow, wearing 108 golden golden light, is as large as a bowl, and wraps the god dove. Jin Guang was everywhere, and Zhu Huan flew back. Looking at the dove, there is a golden light in the mouth. It is also surrounded by the golden light rainbow around the body. Knowing that he was made by Master Buddha, he was useless. Seeing that Lin Han was standing on the side, he was very worried. He was busy with Yunfeng and four small schools. He went to the Buddhist room in his own way, and asked Lin Han what was urgent. Lin Han hurriedly said.  It turned out that the old apes were robbed since then and borrowed the ancient jade runes from the Zen master to return to the hole. In this case, I know the function of jade symbols and love. Helplessly agreed with Zen Master to return to years, and dare not lose trust. The last time I went to the upper mountain to return, it was not out of their wishes. The original intention is that this is a treasure of Xuanmen. It is useless to take it in the Buddhism. The master of the Zen master is high, let alone this, but go to an explanation, indicating that it does not lose his trust, and then he gives the Zen master for his hard work. Who knows that as soon as he arrived at the gate of Mirror Temple, someone was waiting for it. Coincidentally, before he returned the symbol, he took an uncertainty and went late for a day. He thought that the Zen master saw the strangeness, and suddenly he had unexpectedly. He didn&rsquo;t think deeply. I was reluctant. Suddenly, it was seen that Lin Han was not a disciple of Buddhist Buddhist disciples. He felt a flaw, and he had a doubtful thought. At that time, he would fly into the temple, pretend to thank him, and check it. Firstly, Lin Han is also a person who comes to borrow a symbol from the Zen master. After being scared away by the three treasures on the hall, after returning to the mountain, the darkness: &quot;</p>
<p>When the Zen master borrowed the conclusion, he was still compassionate, and afterwards, he tried to cultivate good results. At least you have to be reluctant to meet. Even if it is one day late, how can you wait for a foreigner to wait for? You must not be able to enter the temple to worship yourself. Light, it seems to be deeply guarded by yourself? &ldquo;The more I want to be doubtful, I decided to go to the temple again. I still want to wait for the opportunity to give the ancient jade runes when I did not participate in Xie En last night. Start.  The second day when Lin Han walked a long time, he arrived twice, flying in the air, and seeing a middle -aged monk standing at the door of the temple from a distance. As soon as the ape essence landed, he stopped the Zen stick, stopped the temple door, and drank: &quot;</p>
<p>This is the quiet Zen gate, where the elves, dare to break in! The disciple of the Zen Master Tie Face Monk, the monk, was the only one who refers to the Zen master&rsquo;s door first, and he dare not commit it. As soon as I endured anger, I bowed myself, and I laughed: &ldquo;It is ridiculous, you have been cultivating for many years, and have turned around for many years, but this is so ambitious. Fei Sheng Bliss, I do n’t know at all, and I still disturb my Buddhist doors. Towards that you ignorance, go quickly. &quot;</p>
<p>Ape Jing heard the words and understood that it was fooled last night. It is expected that this monk is not easy to mess with, and asked angrily: &ldquo;Since the Zen Master has soared, why did he deceive my treasure last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>What? Treasures should have it for you. Why did you handle it with others last night? You repay your debt, he gets his own compensation, he has his origin, you have your cause and effect. What is it called a treasure? How do you do it? If you do n’t leave the road, you ca n’t get it clearly. If you stay, you ca n’t escape justice. &ldquo;Although the old ape has a soul, disaster is not full, the fire is in my heart, which knows how to know. The teacher&rsquo;s order, pointing to him, he was furious in time, and the monk asked for the person who went to his jade rune yesterday to go to his jade rune. At the end of the end, he released two blue light from the peach and wooden sword. He wanted to hurt people. Eat a martial arts rod, and discounted the two sword light. The ape was shocked, and then he knew that the monk was powerful, and he couldn&rsquo;t clear the enemy. 沤 沤 returned to the temple with a smile, and did not catch up.  The apes guessing the monk and the Zen master in the temple must have a lot of feats. They also wanted to return the jade runes, but they were also amazing. They even found out the origin of the monk in the two -day temple. Partially refers to the Zen master and the unknown Zen master. They are brothers in the same door. They often retreat to practice in the Zen Gate. Seven unknown Zen masters and apprentices were sitting in the Zen Guan, and they caught up for decades. Although the Zen Master often has Lin Han, he often goes down the mountain to accumulate foreign skills, but he never allows him to be his name, and Lin Han has not been shaved. Originally, few people knew that the two monks&rsquo; origin, interacting with Ape essence, nineteen as the left side of the left, and the followers of the followers. Thinking about it, he had to use the magic weapon to practice in his life, along with the remaining forty -seven peaches and wooden swords, and rushed to the mountain three times. As soon as Miao Zai flew, he changed another monk to wait for him. He still lost his back when he played against each other. It seems that I want to do my best, go six times in a row, and change a enemy every time. Six disciples such as Tianchen, West Lai, Du, Unknown, and Du&rsquo;er in the unknown Zen master will be performed one by one. So many magic weapons. Forty -nine peaches flying swords have been folded for twenty -eighth, and they are deeply revenge. In the end, he fought the strange danger, thinking that every time you defeated, you could get away with the change of mystery, and it would be better to get revenge at most, otherwise it would be better to get revenge; No one knows the origin, and is so powerful. So Yi Ming was dark, and did not go outside the mountain gate to call the enemy.
This time he was sneaked into the temple.</p>
<p>Seeing that the enemies were sitting in the temple, there was only one old monk among them.</p>
<p>Ape essence is also a long -standing enemy.</p>
<p>Although fortunately this is good, he has doubts because of the old monk.</p>
<p>I thought: &quot;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those six are already all enemy, not to mention their master; Moreover, every time they come to know, one person has been waiting outside the door. Copyly. The corner of the temple, staying for a while, but also before, dare not start. I was looking forward to asking, and suddenly saw that the old monk had the old monk, and smiled at him. I don&rsquo;t know how to escape, where can I be busy. Listening to the Zen Master, &ldquo;Zen door is clean, can you be a monster and ghost? The disciples are not brought with me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice lived, the golden light was bright, the disciple of the Zen master Tian Chen had been holding a Zen stick, and he appeared in the front and blocked it. Go to the road. The apes had previously handed over his hands with him. He knew that his mana was strong, and he was infinitely infinite in his hands. There were several magic weapons, all of which were sent in his hands. How dare you dare to resist the enemy? Encountered the two disciples of Wu Du, Wuming, and intercepted their heads. Knowing the crisis of things, he had to fight with the two Zen sticks. He still changed with mystery and turned into a flash of light. When it was going to break the sky, the eyes were shining in front of the eyes. In the sudden, I couldn&rsquo;t see that it was a treasure, but I felt that the disease was like lightning. When the head was pressed down, it would be said to escape. A chill war on his body fought, and he lost his consciousness immediately. When I woke up and opened my eyes, seven enemies and apprentices were still meditating. The breeze is blew, the stars are in the sky, and the inside and outside of the hall are quiet. It&rsquo;s not a nightmare, it is by no means a fighter. Darkness: &ldquo;Shi Cai obviously heard the old monk seeing the hidden hidden, and the disciples were besieged by the disciples. Now they are neither injured nor captured. Isn&rsquo;t it? &quot;</p>
<p>I also feel that nothing is reasonable. Checking the enemy&rsquo;s expression carefully, it seems that it has been settled for a long time and has no awareness. Although he was very surprised, because of his revenge, he was really fantasy, and he had no time to think about it, but he thought that the enemy really did not peek at himself. Take advantage of his unpreparedness, use the change of mystery, rush into the hall, start with the same calculation, and take the life of the Zen master and apprentice.  The idea was hit, just waiting to fly to the hall, and the whole body was banned, and the effort was exhausted. Only then did you know that he was in the enemy ’s rivals. It was true that the talents were bound to be bound. It was not dreamy. It was a dream. Maybe the soul of the afterbing of hard work for many years, the body of the semi -immortal body must be destroyed. This urgency is really wrong, from anxiety and regret, the more regrets, the more sad, the more sad, and the more you can&rsquo;t help crying. In the juncture of life and death, he couldn&rsquo;t help but exhale the jealousy of the rigidity. He softened in time, whispered and sorrowful, and cried: &ldquo;Zen Master Luohan, poor little animals are hard -working, and it is not easy. There is no big, never hurting people easily. The master of the Zen has pity compassion, and has borrowed the fairy symbols to help the small animals become a path. It is just for the difference of thoughts, greed and calamity. The Zen Master refers to the master of the temple on behalf of the Zen master, and must be the same way. Qian Qi Nian is a little grace in the master of the Zen Master into a whole little animal. Later, Dingdang disappeared the mountains, and he never dared to look at the Buddhist gate again. &quot;</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t help crying here, saying it again, and again. Zen Master and apprentice still sit on the futon, closing his eyes, the gods of the gods, the primal of the treasure, the more solemn and silent, and still seem to be unaware.  Originally, after the apes, the soul was easy to repair for many years. It was suffered several years of hard work. At this time, it was said that the karma of revenge has disappeared. After seeing the trapped, the enemy has never been spicy, and he seems to be in the precepts. As soon as I was lucky, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel a little happy. After seeing the Zen Master&rsquo;s own asks, he ignored him for a long time. When he was captured by the recall of his remembrance, he was quite decisive. After sitting up, he had to come to the poisonous hand, and couldn&rsquo;t help but be afraid of sadness. After a while, I thought again: &ldquo;The Buddhist Gate is vast, known as compassion, Pu Du sentient beings, better than people. Although he should not be greedy, he talked about it first. It is quite self -love, and it is very different from other weirds and other weirds. It is wrong to be injured. It is already very wronged. The monk refers to the sin of the Zen master, compassion and pity. He held it, provoked himself, and the song was not in me. The karma has been regretful, and he has confession and regrets. How can this monitor be so cruel? Being begging him overnight, it is indifferent. &quot;</p>
<p>It can&rsquo;t help but be difficult to curb and furious. I just wanted to move the robbery, scold the enemy for a game, and almost temporarily thought, saved the immortality, and the five internal hangs were uncomfortable. The words &ldquo;bald donkey&rdquo;</p>
<p>and &ldquo;thief monk&rdquo;</p>
<p>have not yet been exported. Another thought of being caught by the previous time, beheading the flying sword, the swimming soul floats, between the floating grass, there is no home, and the subtitaus of the mountains, all kinds of suffering; This time it is the formation of soul cultivation. It is not a body. It is much more precious. After the victim, it is not possible to know that it is not the second time. Intersection Thinking of the danger, the horror was trembling. Thinking about it, I still begging for it, or there is a little hope of survival. It seems to be so worried and happy, when you are angry, you are scared, and the sorrow is seven, and at the same time, it is gathered on the heart, like 15 buckets, seven and eight. Finally went to the confession service to lose, in order to avoid death. It ’s a good thing to say, it’ s really infinitely sorrowful, not sad, seven days and seven nights, never stopped. It was easy to cry until the last day of the night, and then I saw the Zen Master Qi Qiqi, and said with a smile, &ldquo;Do you still laugh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Essence The words were right, and the Zen master drank: &ldquo;If you want to come, come and go, you forget to return, who keeps you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After speaking these four sentences, his eyes closed again. The apes heard the words and were surprised. Fang was going to cry for seven days. The Master Qian Qian was released, and he suddenly felt that he could move. It was so easy to think that the enemy was not harmed. The fish broke away from the net, and when he was born, he fled back to the mountain in panic, and he dared not go to the top of the mountain.  After three years, the apes have taken medicine and met two new friends who have been newly associated in recent years: First, the famous figures in the younger generations of the younger generations are good at good; The cave travels Longzi Wei. Because the apes knew about the different categories, the joy was close to the expert. Although Xiang and Wei knew that he was a alien, he did not do much, and the roots were very thick. They were good at changing mystery. Respect and respect people. Therefore, at the expense of discounting, it is set to be forgotten friends, and often goes back.  I met in the middle of the Yunyun Mountain in the middle of the day, and I was glad. Starting from the scrutiny of each person&rsquo;s swordsmanship, later, when I was high, they put their own flying swords, compared with each other for a while, and talked about the film. go. Who knows that this sword is a drama, which almost gives the ape essence and causes the calamity. At that time, Xu Fei was passing by the air. I didn&rsquo;t know who it was first. Because she saw that she was not an Emei faction, she was born with heart, and she fell far from her body, hiding her shape, and peeping forward. At first sight, there was You Longzi Wei, and he knew that he was upright. The last time Ciyun Temple was not originally wish. When he met, he was boring and boring. Seeing that Wei Shao Shao talked with his sword, he quietly talked beside him, and he was heard to talk about the past. Although Wei Shaoyou was widely heard, he only knew that the master of Zen was probably about the master of the Zen. Xiang Xiangxing has been saying a long time, even more. The ape essence is entrusted and Wei, on behalf of the visiting people of the decent, in the end, what is the origin of the seven new monks in Jingbo Temple, and the loss and incomplete value of the last time. I knew that I had no revenge, and she was heard by Xu Fei. She didn&rsquo;t know who the seven of the masters and apprentices were, she only felt organic. At that time, because he listened to the apes, he was uncomfortable and did not show up. He only followed the secret, and when he arrived in front of his hole, he walked. First find the five ghost kings Shangheyang, ask the first half of the reason, and know that Lin Han will return to the gate of Emei in the future. In the different factions, he brought inquiries, asking the experts to calculate, but she was made up by her. I just don&rsquo;t know where Lin Han had the jade rune, where to swim. His reputation is too great, afraid that the ape essence is unwilling to be in the flow, and deliberately finds a Sanxian in the cottage of Hainan Island. Go to the ape essence, inform the bottom of the time, and encourage him to find Lin Han to revenge.
The name of the Sanxian is Yunyi, originally a Li people, and lived in Lili Mountain, Wuzhishan, Hainan Island for many years.</p>
<p>Xu Fei Niang said that he had to have the true biography of his mother because he heard that he had a lot of albums.</p>
<p>He could curse the water without flowing, the flames were not burning, and the people lived and died at will.</p>
<p>When he talked about each other, Xu Fei asked him to advice and learned to detachment of Liuding and pseudo -shaped prohibited techniques; and sent him a sword to pass the method of refining the sword.</p>
<p>Yun Yi was born in Lijiao because of his own background.</p>
<p>Unlike other Xuanmen patriarchal law, he regretted that he would not fly swords.</p>
<p>As a result, the two became Mo Ni.</p>
<p>On this day, he was entrusted by Fei Niang and rushed to the peak.</p>
<p>He came out at the ape essence, and the cave door was closed.</p>
<p>That Da Mountain is in the north of the Minjiang River, south of Fuding County, confrontation with Donggong Mountain, the peaks are lonely, lonely, and it is not connected with the mountains of Nanling.</p>
<p>The Moxiao Peak where the apes are living are the top of the mountain, all sides are all sea, and they are very good at the wonderful cave.</p>
<p>When you go, the weather in Jiuqiu, according to the peaks, below is thousands of mountains, and you can make up your eyes.</p>
<p>Danfeng yellow oranges everywhere, reflecting purple flowing gold, dyed through frost.</p>
<p>The above is Gao Wenyun, the middle of the sky, and the sun is red, and it is scattered.</p>
<p>Seeing it further away, it was the sea wide sky.</p>
<p>The real is bright and bright, cold and gorgeous, with thousands of weather, which is overwhelming.</p>
<p>Yun Yi played for a while, and saw the twilight, and the color was all -in -law.</p>
<p>He thought that the ape essence would be far away, and he would not return.</p>
<p>Suddenly, when I heard the apes, I saw the far sky, and faintly flew.</p>
<p>In love, the ape essence returned to the cave, and stopped, looking at the sea negatively, pretending to be unsteady.</p>
<p>After a while, he listened to the sound of breaking, straight at the top of the peak, and the cave door suddenly opened.</p>
<p>Looking back, the ape essence had entered the hole, and I saw a back, and the sound of apes whistling in the cave.</p>
<p>When Yunyi saw that the ape essence did not answer, he couldn&rsquo;t talk, and was inconvenient to be an unexpected guest.</p>
<p>He broke into each other and met him.</p>
<p>I have to pretend to be in the end, and wait for a while to see how he.</p>
<p>Fang is in the face of the sea, and it should be something.</p>
<p>As soon as the ape essence arrived, he saw that he was not a serious way.</p>
<p>He wanted to close the hole and ignore him.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have received two small apes with root wares.</p>
<p>They are all good things.</p>
<p>They looked out of the cave and read it clearly.</p>
<p>Return to the person outside the cave, and came from the afternoon to take a look at the cave for a while, and took the chicken bone from the side of the body, like a hexagram.</p>
<p>At the end of the end, I was thinking about it, looking around everywhere.</p>
<p>Although he did not enter the cave, he had stayed in front of the cave for a few hours.</p>
<p>Seeing that he seemed to go, smelled the sound, and stopped and waited.</p>
<p>The apes heard that the person who knew that the came from the peak was either who wanted to win the cave, or to take it.</p>
<p>If you ignore the households, he will never give up, he will never stop.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, let&rsquo;s be courteous and then the soldiers.</p>
<p>Because I wanted to try the depth of the person, I quietly flashed out of the hole, and it was about to do the law.</p>
<p>Yunyi had noticed and returned to him.</p>
<p>The ape essence was not as good as Shi Wei, so he had to ask him to ask: &ldquo;Daoyou has arrived at the deserted mountain day after noon, but hasn&rsquo;t it so far, but does it see teachings?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yunyi knew that it was abnormal and replied, &quot; People Yunyi, because of picking medicine to the cave palace, saw the peak higher than the heavenly watch, and accidentally appeared with Xing Xing. The bone of Youxian is different, and the torque is rushing. The Dao Xing must be deep, and it is ten times higher than the poverty. Maybe I am foolish and teach one or two? &quot;</p>
<p>The ape is essential, and she is happy, and the coming people are modest, and they can&rsquo;t help but feel good. Although he understood that the first half of the scene was coming, it was some false. I thought: &ldquo;Although this person is not a first -class, he is not very annoying. Xu is inadvertently here, seeing the Tibetan, not to talk about it. Why not? &quot;</p>
<p>The current agreed, just above the rock of the peak, invited Yunyi to talk to each other. The two small apes in the cave will be taken from the newly adopted from Daiyun Mountain Valley in the Grand Longan and Mandarin sleeves. The apes were affected by the demon because of the previous robbery; this person has no reason today, and has never heard of his name. He couldn&rsquo;t measure his heart. He always felt a little suspicious and did not enter the hole. Yun Yi knew that he was moving to the micro, and talked about guidance and vomiting, and gave him a high hat to wear. Seeing that he saw him to be modest, his words were subtle.  Yunyi was able to stop, not staying in a long time. When he sat on the moon, he returned. During the walk, he tried to try the odds and deliberately revealed his hand. It is the night clouds and the wind is light, and the light is as light as day. It is based on the broad and infinite sea surface. Yun Yi thinks that Haitao is ups and downs, it is not as good as the blue waves. It ’s rare to go home with intended to walk, from the sea, enjoy the upper and lower sky, and go back to Hainan Island. The ape essence he heard that he had said that he had a banned spell, and he heard that he wanted to curse the sea. It was suspected that he was showing off and pretending to send him for a long time. Yunyi knew the purpose, and immediately invited ape essence to fly from the peak to the sea. It is about to reach, just as the wind is tide, the waves are like mountains, and the momentum is even more turbulent. Yunyi mouth recite the ban, and the hands finger, when the waves are standing, but the waves are unbound, Chengbo stops, the static is not flowing, the ocean is clear, and the autumn and moon photos are taken. Qing, swimming fish in the sea, and fins. On the pedestrian, it was flat and slippery, without staining, the reflection entered the water, and the hair was countless. It was like walking on a strange crystal mirror. Ape essence has repeatedly used the wisdom eyes. Except for the departure, there are hundreds of miles on both sides and dozens of feet followed by the recovery shape. I am so good to be in my heart, and I can&rsquo;t help dumping. Yunyi wanted to feel the exquisite eyes of apes, and saw that he couldn&rsquo;t curse all over the sea. He smiled and said, &ldquo;Small surgery beside the door. Ask for advice, let&rsquo;s say goodbye. &quot;</p>
<p>The apes also booked a post -appointment in accordance with the time when the night was used, and the footsteps stopped. When they just resigned, they saw that Yunyi was motionless, but people were like archery. On the endless crystal wave, fly forward. Wherever the seas are flying, the waves are fiercer than before, and between the waves and falls, people are from large and small, from small to hidden, and gradually disappear.  After a few days after the apes, Yunyi came to visit again, only to extend the money into the hole. As a result, he often returned and became a close friend. Yun Yi first suffered the soul of the apes, and went through the hatred with the unknown monk. Fei Niang wanted to be apes ape essence. When he heard that he had been suffered by the master, he was happy and thought that he could be with the enemy and attributed himself to his party. It was called Yun Yi to inform the people who robbed his jade, named Lin Han, and the disciples of Emei sent by the unknown monk to persuade him to take revenge. He also persuaded him to set up a alien person and other different factions to find a master and Emei Gate. Who knows quickly. When Ape Essence asked to borrow the soul of the jade, the monk refers to the Zen Master once warned: &ldquo;It is easy for you to practice hard for many years, and it is easy for you to borrow Bao Cheng. If you do n’t cry, you ca n’t encounter me, you will always be a different kind, and even the ghost fairy cannot be repaired. Moreover, Shen Ni You is a fellow. You have become a climate, and you are not an opponent. Go to find revenge and send it to death. Would you like to do your original intention? &quot;</p>
<p>Ape Jing vowed again and again, never remembered revenge, and repaired foreign contributions to report as full of virtue. On weekdays, he learned that Fei Niang and others were sinful, and he had a prejudice in his chest. He was very careful about making friends. In this case, Fang Zhiyun wing was not good at it, and suddenly realized that at the time, he was furious. Although he could not forget the affection, he had absolutely intersecting Yunyi. And let the martial arts such as Fei Niang, such as the evil, and delusional thoughts. I just wanted to find Lin Han to get the treasures of the lost. Two times, the words were lost, and they became friends on the Mo Xiaofeng, and fought for seven days and seven nights. Although Yunyi was exquisite in spells, the helpless ape sophisticated merit changed, and the wonderful use was very useful. I couldn&rsquo;t help but make him not to control him. Due to accidental negligence during the first fight, he almost ate a lot of apes. Later, I barely tied. On the morning of the last morning, he visited Shan and Wei Shao, and he took three forces to drive the cloud wing away. As a result, the two sides became the opposite.  Rao was the opportunity to understand such as ape essence, and he still became the fantasy of Fei Niang. He returned from the upper upper and overdue, and since he saw that the unknown master and apprentice were so powerful, the people who robbed the rolls must be the same party, nor the weak. Even if you find it, you may not be able to take it back, and you will cause trouble. Sometimes when I think of it, I will be sad for a while, just. And when he learned that Lin Han&rsquo;s origin, he was not a monk. Yun Yi said that he was unusual and did not know the authenticity. He disappeared after seeing his robbery. Moreover, this rune originally refers to the lending master of the Zen master. The original owner is not a mortal. If it is also the treasure, it is very easy. This symbol is not a magic weapon of Buddhism. It can be seen that pitying that he can keep the precepts and be good. It is really unwilling to be taken over. No matter the fairy Buddha, it must be reasonable. Anonymous monk has captured himself without any harm. Otherwise, he would make him seven times, how can he be so cheap? With his strength, I used to go with each other, and to make up the house with their own skills, everyone was the same. Besides, I am right and meet their ability. Waiting for Lin Han, if you can&rsquo;t do it, he simply died of this heart and saved often.
Together with the thoughts of greed, I lived again, and talked about the matter with Xiang and Wei first.</p>
<p>Xiang and Wei heard that he did not agree with Fei Niang, and agreed.</p>
<p>However, because he wanted to find Lin Han to capture treasure, he felt that it was inappropriate, and persuaded: &ldquo;Now that Emei is in the Changming period, there are also many people in the descendants. However, the two factions of Kunlun and Emei often have colleagues. Although there were gaps in Ciyun Temple in the past, they have been mediation recently. A few disciples under the door are well -known, and they have not heard of Lin Hanqi. They are currently being. When he accumulated foreign contributions, he couldn&rsquo;t disappear for the jade rune, and he seemed to laugh. You didn&rsquo;t know his master&rsquo;s surname. How could he act? It is best not to be greedy. Really reluctant, I also make things clear and do things clearly. &quot;</p>
<p>Fei Niang&rsquo;s original intention was to add branches to the enemy of Emei, and to add leaves to the leaves. Unexpectedly, the apes listened to the words of Xiang and Wei. After a long time, it was not until the trustee repeatedly listened to the Emei faction, knowing Wu Linhan. I was struggling to do not know where she was, and then went to Lin Han&rsquo;s hometown to inquire about Lin Han&rsquo;s birthday, setting up altars in the Moxiao Peak Cave, and taking the prohibition of Lin Han&rsquo;s true soul. The original intention was taken to the whole god, forcing him to confess his place, and to offer the jade runes, that is, he was put in line, and he had no meaning of harm at the beginning. Huai Zhi Lin Han was self -cultivation, and the foundation was solid. The apes were sacrificed for forty -nine days, so it was easy to take the true god into the hole, and was renewed. At the same time, Lin Han also perceived, hurriedly rushed to Master Fen Tuo for help, and learned King Kong and Tianlong Zen. The ape essence can not only take his mind anymore, but the soul and evil law are broken, but the spells passed by Master Fen Tuo were broken. The ape essence is not good at seeing things, and it is quite difficult to retreat.  After a long time, the ape sophisticated swimming in Dongting, wanting to be full of Dongshan Baisha monopoly, and planned to choose the breeds and moved it under the Moxiao Peak with spells. Under Mo Cafeng, it was the night of looking at the night, the moonlight received thousands of hectares, and the water and the sky were full of water. The night scene is very clear. The ape essence was in the ranging forest. When he was struggling, at a glance at the mountain of Linwu, Xia Guang treasured, he rushed to Xiaohan, knowing that there were treasures appearing. Because the cave in the forest house is mostly inhabited from the fairy spirit, recently, the two people say that there are strangers living in the cave. The summer and night were short, and when the son was ugly, it was closer to Tianming. The treasure was still unmoved. After careful observation, it seemed to be revealed by the soil of the mountain temple, not like a stranger in the cave showing off. I dare not take the liberty first. Once they are stubborn, the sky has been clear, and the treasure is gradually hidden. Darkness: &ldquo;This is strange, is the treasure at hand, and the people in the cave have not noticed it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Want to stop, but reluctant. The sky is bright, and the residents up and down the mountain have got up. The sails in the lake are far away, and the sound of the sound is that the fishing song belongs. The ape essence has not been dug yet, because it may cause the people to be harsh, and again. After thinking about it, there is no strange appearance in the forestow cave. The inner cave Jinting Yuzhu is a hundred miles deep, isolated from the world, far away from the world. Essence  When I rushed to Xishan to see, there were many residents up and down in the mountains, mixed with temples. Last night, the treasure rose was approaching at the left of Baoshan Temple, and there was no difference. Putting around the temple around, I couldn&rsquo;t find the slightest trace, and I was wondering. Thinking of the Han Dynasty&rsquo;s fairy Liu Gen, he cultivated Mo Caifeng, and later he settled the forest house. After the road, he had a green hair. There were black and white apes under the door to serve. It is said that Mao Gong&rsquo;s altar is next to the west view, and there is Mao Gong&rsquo;s town altar on the altar. It is not only the ancient immortal ruins, and this treasure must be a bit related. So I quickly found the spirit of the temple and looked at it. There was a stone altar, the fairy spirit, the empty storage of the site, and the stone lean altar, and gradually abandoned the place where shepherds swim in the cooling place. Deeply looking at the lake last night, I only saw that the treasure was buried in the left near the left. It had not been tracked here, and it was not ascending to see the accurateness, which was clueless. In case you don&rsquo;t appear tonight, or you can get it in the first place, wouldn&rsquo;t it be lost?  The ape essence was sighing, suddenly listening to a lying shirty hometown on the stone bars on the side of the altar, and said to the old man who had just slept under the left tree on the left, &ldquo;Uncle Amgen, a true spirit of the Mao Gong Bodhisattva. I took it the day before. The old man burned a fragrance. He went to Suzhou City to sell loquats yesterday, saying that as soon as he entered the city early in the morning, he encountered a large man in a large man, walked out of a playful aunt, shouted in the garden, please go out, please go out, please go out. An old lady, a person who has a personality and kindness, leaves all a burden, and divert me doubled a copper puppet. I also said that the people in the country in the country had a hard time to do business. There is a little vegetable and vegetables to eat. Take a Chen Guang and ask me to pick another burden of Bai Sand every three or five days, and I have to dial more copper. The old lady is really conscience. Such a big blessing. &quot;</p>
<p>The old man replied:&rdquo; Weird Fajie is high in the sun and the sun is high, and Ephesus is doing business. He also takes the wind and cools, and he is sleepy. To say, Mao Gong Bodhisattva has a monument, and it wants to look at the Erladse. In the observation of Ku Tsai, I did n’t have any incense in the view of the past. There is a solid spiritual test. What happened to Ruan in the morning this morning, the sky is full of wind, and the wind is cool. ? &quot;</p>
<p>Han Xidi said:&rdquo; You shouted people, who would go to all beings. &quot;</p>
<p>Then, rolled over and grabbed a large puppet fan, opened the crotch, fanned it twice, and then then he wiped out. Go.  The apes are coming to the mountains, and they rarely opposite the world. Although Dongting West Mountain is a place of old travel, most of them are in the air, avoiding people, and never talking to Turks. This time, because of the treasure hunt, listening to the two people, Wu Yin, is very familiar, as if I used to listen to it before, I couldn&rsquo;t help standing. I couldn&rsquo;t think of where I heard it, and I heard that I was helping the monument, and suddenly I moved. Darkness: &ldquo;The town altar is under the monument, and the legend of the fairy traces is quite different; the treasure is discovered in this area again. Why not go to see it? Maybe you can find a clue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Stop: &ldquo;The two do not need to call people. This is the fairy traces of the Taoist family, and if it is not allowed to collapse, how about the poverty -stricken way to help each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tao: &ldquo;Personally like a third child, the Elder Views of the Episoga, relying on a few hectares of orchards, Xianga burned. It will be overweight. , I still call a few more people to help each other. &quot;</p>
<p>Ape Jing laughed:&rdquo; It&rsquo;s okay. The two only led me, but I don&rsquo;t need to do it. It was a sudden, with a big talk, and glanced at each other, &quot;</p>
<p>Is it easy?&rdquo; After that, Xing Chong led the apes and left.  Crossing Mao Gong, walking into a fruit forest, seeing a stone monument, lying down. The apes were not established on the altar. When I asked the reason, I realized that the prescription was the original site of the old Mao Gong altar. The altar was not large. Only Zhang Xu saw the side. Viewed that the Taoist priests had a fertile land on the side of the greedy altar, and they had to attach fairy traces to rebuild a altar several times larger on the side of the view, but abolished the original altar into a fruit forest. In the end, because the incense was not strong, even the new altar was not repaired, and it collapsed. First, the original altar occupied the land, but helpless was a whole stone. After years of pebine, the land was thick, and the original altar was obstructing, so it was covered with the soil and covered it. Try another kind of tree seedlings, which are extraordinarily lush and long. Only this stone monument is left, and in the soil, if you have a root, you can do everything possible. Gradually, there is spiritual spirit, so so far. After a few days ago, after a day of thunderstorms, the monument suddenly pulled himself, and he was in the heart of the priest, and planned to wait for the opportunity to transport the bottom of the lake. The old man was seventy years old, and he had been known for passing it. The apes look at the monument in detail. The long abbot is only two feet and seven inches wide, and there are traces of soil erosion in the lower half. Lean down and reach out the monument, and lift it up gently. At first glance, the monument is authentic, it is strange. After the monument started, there was a point, Xia Guang&rsquo;s treasure, faintly revealed from the acupuncture point, and could not help but surprise. This acupoint is now, and the treasures must be below. At that time, I was not known by others, so I took it away. Looking at the situation, treasures must be deeply hidden in the ground, and it is not easy. It was also afraid that it was shocking, shocked the people who lived in the cave in the forest house, causing competition, causing right and wrong. Repeatedly, only the monument is still placed back to the original acupoint, secretly sealing the ban method, and still waiting for late at night. Busy slowly holding the monument and supporting it to the acupoint. After the law, the Ershan people saw him so divine and all suspected of being a god.
The apes will be planned, and the two will still come to the altar in the evening to cool down, but they are not allowed to reveal the words.</p>
<p>When the Taoist priest met like a question, he only said that the monument was independent for no reason.</p>
<p>It must be beneficial at night.</p>
<p>The Ershan people thanked and thanked.</p>
<p>The apes simply sold a magical power, flying up in the fire, still looking at the top of the mountain nearby.</p>
<p>There was nothing wrong with the sunset, and he had a good meal.</p>
<p>First go to Suzhou City, choose the big family of the rich, and stole thousands of gold and silver.</p>
<p>I am afraid that the matter will be harmed, and after getting the hands, they will use spells to change it one by one.</p>
<p>Divided into three copies, took Dongshan to eat a family of people overnight, shouting the door, saying that it was God, buying fruit from him, leaving a copy.</p>
<p>When the night is the night, the remaining two copies will be taken to Mao Gong.</p>
<p>The ape essence gave everyone a copy.</p>
<p>The original altar was secure, the fruit was not familiar, and the Chinese priests were unknown.</p>
<p>Looking at the monument again, it is really no one who has no one.</p>
<p>At the moment, he took out Xiaosan and gave it to the Ershan people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you see a person who has a face to break into the forest, you can make this vanian three times. No matter how fierce the momentum is, he should not dare to hurt you. The sound, quickly throwing up the sky, took the gold and silver home, there was nothing about you. &quot;</p>
<p>Er Shanmin was heavily funded and regarded him as a fairy. Ape Jing knew that no one was aware of it, and he still had to do this. It was a moment of carefulness and prevents in case; happened to have these two villagers who were willing to be willing to drive him. Unexpectedly, it was almost a loss.  At this time, Bao Guangxia Mang had already risen. Although the monument is erected during the day, and there is a ban on the prohibition, it still cannot be covered. After the ape essence is allocated, it is even less negligent. After a while, a deep acupuncture point was opened under the monument, and the light was more prosperous. I don&rsquo;t know what to do, I just felt my heart beating. It was amazing. The bottom of the soil at the bottom of the cave flocked, and a piece of jade was available first, with Xuanmen Daqing Fuyan and some handwriting. Knowing that the treasure was below, it was about to show. Then he reached out and took it out. He didn&rsquo;t look at it. The sound of breaking through the sky was flying from the sky to the forest. Then he heard that people were talking to Ershan Min. The person who expected that the arrival was not good. In his heart, he only hoped that the Ershan people could keep the appointment for a while. Otherwise, it would inevitably lose it. I was so anxious that I couldn&rsquo;t even look back at it. Fortunately, it was drooping and dazzling, and there was an iron box in the hole, and the treasure light revealed from the box. There is a hook and a sword on the box, which is very familiar. He quickly took it together and saw that Baoguang in the hole was hidden. I was still afraid, and I wanted to search down again. When I was busy, I was in a busy time. A long -sized Taoist with a blue -faced star crown, with her hands, five Lei Tianxin Zhengjue, was being shocked. One is not easy to reconcile, and there may be a flash of flashes; the other is afraid that people are in a hurry, hurting the two mountain people, and it is to make evil. I was busy holding the iron box, hooks, and swords, raised the light, and shouted, and broke the air.  The two mountains were very loyal, and they worshiped the life of the apes. After a while, I suddenly listened to the sound of hug, and in a blink of an eye dropped a high -profile Taoist priest. Go into the forest. Ershan people know that in the middle of the night and three times, it is almost weird. However, because of gold and silver, I witnessed the light and shadow of the old Taoist in the day. I have a preconceived opinion, thinking that there is a fairy in the forest, and it may be as good as the fairy. It is worth eating by the monster, not to mention that there are treasures in your hands. At that time, according to the apes, he shook the people from the daisan. The man was in a hurry with the treasure hunt, and he never saw ambush. At a glance, someone in the forest was first, so that it was the doctrine of the side, and his heart was furious. I was about to drink and rushed in, and I felt the sky turned around. The method of the Taiqing Five Elements prohibited method appeared in front, which blocked the road. At the beginning, there was still a monster party, and he was busy looking at it. It was two ordinary people. One is unwilling to hurt innocence, and the other is quite expensive. First, use good words to persuade, saying that Lin Zhongtao is a weird, not to help the abuse, that is, walk away and avoid being affected. Unexpectedly, the people of the mountain are solid eyes. If they come up, they will hardly come with them, but they can scare away. Seeing that the Taoist was born again, it was a strangeness, stubbornness, and unreasonable reasoning. The man was so useless and useless. When the Taoist saw the apes shining, the treasure property had been taken out before it was anxious. It is waiting to exercise Wu Leitian&rsquo;s heart to the Fa -rectification, break the ban into the forest, and see the apes. The Ershan people smelled the air in the air and busy putting their hands up in one fell swoop. The apes returned to the hand, and they had escaped. The Taoist was furious, that is, the light of light, broke the air, and followed. When I knew it was, I worshiped for a while and wished each other.  Although ape essence is alien, swordsmanship is extremely deep. After robbing the soul, I know it. More than a change of mystery, flying extinct, all thousands of miles. If the Taoist chased was not far, he was invisible by him, without seeing the trace. At that time, I didn&rsquo;t know where it was weird. The apes were buried under the Mao Gong, and returned to Mo Xiaofeng. They were afraid to find the head to come to the door. Then walk into the inner cave, the more you look at those treasures, the more familiar, it looks like the common things you have before; remembering your life, you have never seen it: the heart is strange. When I took a hook and a sword, I couldn&rsquo;t think of what was because. Take a look at the iron box, and there is a barrier in the outside. The trial hook was sewed by the box, a golden light flashed, and the box suddenly split, it was a few iron. There is also a wooden box that is long, four inches wide, and the handwriting is carved on the box. The box was opened and opened, and there was a silk book in it. The &ldquo;Inner Scenic Yuanzong&rdquo;</p>
<p>was written in writing. Open it and look at it. The book is all the secrets of Taoist Tuna&rsquo;s practice. According to this practice, it is enough to raise the fairy to prove the fruit. After turning to the back, I found the message from the Lvmaishan people. It is said that since the Han Dynasty got the way, he lived in the cave, and he had his own pale two apes on his side. In the cave in the forest house, I lived in a hundred years, and I realized myself. He is the author of four volumes of &ldquo;Danshu&rdquo;</p>
<p>, three volumes of &ldquo;Xianxian&rdquo;</p>
<p>upper and lower, and one volume of &ldquo;Inner Scenic Yuanzong&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The first two books are in harmony. This &ldquo;Inner Scenic Sedon&rdquo;</p>
<p>is a shortcut of alien practice. At that time, the future was calculated, and the apes were thicker. Before the mountain people became the road, they borrowed the cave for the master of Tianzhu Unfertile Zen. Disaster, finally re -entered the ape body, and still entered Taoism. Under the Sanyingmen, it is extremely well -known, and there will be achievements. The white ape is blunt, and the longest time with the day, because it is too anxious to advance, go into the demon, destroy the ring, switch to the body, and even three calamities. The mountain people have duceded twice, and they were defeated. Three times of robbery, the mountain industry has been immortal, and he has re -turned his body like Cang Ape. He re -revived the ape body and worked hard for many years. The white ape said is the ape essence. The mountain people are serving the work because they are serving the fruit, and they are specially different. The book was buried under the iron box under the original altar of the town, and there was a town altar and a monument. The treasure hooks, fairy swords and jade slips of Ren Royal Demon. Destiny with hooks, Jian will be given a custard, the sword and this book will be given the ape essence.  The appearance of the apes first saw that the appearance of the book box seemed to be common. And when I read it, I seemed to be unprecedented. After watching the silence of the desert, the things of Jingyi had a lot of life, and Fang Shi suddenly realized that he was actually the old ape under the door of Liu Zhenren. The memories of all the robberies, treated with the fairy division, sorrowful and sorrowful, worshiped in the sky, and thanked him for a while. I thought about it: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where this ape is today? And don&rsquo;t say him. This book is the most easy -to -go. This book is the easiest. Taboo, the charm of the mountains and the wild is difficult to prevent, and it is difficult to prevent the magic head. &quot;</p>
<p>Think about it. Only by recovering the previous jade symbols to prevent the magic from being unpareural. He was seriously disbusted, but helplessly did not know where Lin Han lived and could not start. Put the book next to the book and find it everywhere.  When I was separated, I still couldn&rsquo;t find Lin Han trace, and I came up with one. Knowing that the soul could not come, but when the first law, he could find out the direction of the soul. Just don&rsquo;t think it is trouble to trouble. Once and February, I suddenly come to it once. Looking in this direction, I can always find it sooner or later. Nowadays, it is not unreasonable and patient. Sure enough, for the first time, Lin Han was unexpectedly unwilling to take it. Fortunately, the defense was surgery, and when he found that the ape essence was getting ghosts, he was busy sitting in the meditation method, taking the mind, and not shaking. However, the apes have found the direction from the induction, and did not wait for Lin Han to break him. After a few days of guarding, Lin Han had no movement, thinking that the apes wanted to suddenly take advantage of the gap, and there was no merit. In a few days, the ape essence was used again. It seemed that three times passed, the apes felt that the enemy was far apart. The fourth time flew out of the distance, and rushed to the left to the left to the left before the law began. The ape essence has not changed because of the induction direction, and it is expected that people are hidden deep in the snowy mountains. At the same time, Lin Han also expected that he would perform a secret calculation. He must have tricks and stricter preparations. But the apes are active, and it is difficult to shake. Fortunately, Lin Han used Master Fen Tuo to teach his spells, so he had to know a little. As a result, Ape Jing had almost suffered a small loss. Knowing that the other party is not very good, I am afraid of being alert. If you dare not make it, you will stop searched in the Snow Mountain area every day.
The snowy mountains are wide, the peaks are undulating, the mountains are around, and there are many caves.</p>
<p>Lin Han cannot be repaired.</p>
<p>It is naturally difficult to find.</p>
<p>There were two times in the middle of the peaks of Lin Han, because the wonderful scenery was blocked from the top and bottom, just a small lonely peak, the top of the top was like a pot, the green grass was green, and it was very lush.</p>
<p>The dried pond is similar to the Yanyang top Yanhu Lake.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, there is no hole in the strange scenery below, and the opposite is hidden inside it, and missed it in person.</p>
<p>When the apes flew over for the first time, Lin Han was working hard in the cave.</p>
<p>I do n’t know that the enemy was approaching and gradually involved in the house.</p>
<p>The second apes flew, and Lin Han did not feel the apes for many days.</p>
<p>According to the recent practice, the industry has been overdue, and the gap may be calculated by the gap to prevent stricter prevention.</p>
<p>Although his diamond sitting in the meditation is a beginner, he has no exquisite profound and esoteric.</p>
<p>He can only prevent himself.</p>
<p>He cannot listen to the distance.</p>
<p>After doing my homework on this day, it was just when the ape sperm detoned.</p>
<p>At first, I used mystery, sitting in the diamond Zen method, the gods of the gods, the heart is empty, and the heart of the peak was flying over.</p>
<p>At that time, I was familiar with my ears, and I was silent, but I was surprised.</p>
<p>Darkness: &ldquo;The demon ape has found on the door, and the Dharma is not deep, and it is by no means to resist the meditation. You must predict it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quickly get up, bring all the magic weapons and flying swords beside him, ready to block for a while, and it will never be compared. When the flying was out of the hole, when I looked back, the apes had flew over, and it seemed that there were no one at the bottom of the pool. Don&rsquo;t worry, busy flying into the peak, observing all around, glance at the red light that I saw the ape essence at the top of the mountain before, like a fire snake, it flashed a few flashes in the dark and cloudy clouds. Essence Lin Han saw that the apes had been cultivated for many years, and Dao Xing&rsquo;s mana was more advanced than before: Besides, the teacher&rsquo;s legacy and Master Fen Tuo&rsquo;s words were clearly stated that they were not their opponents and did not dare to light their rivals.  When thinking about it, the fire is electrode, and then revolved. Only in the dense clouds of the sky, the dazzling time was already. Because of the sharp momentum, Lin Han was afraid of being broken, and he was afraid to be seen by him. Seeing that the post -to -see the ape sperm is not Wuzhi Amon, the fierce sound of the fire when he heard the year, but only a little bit of empty voice, and the light is as hot, pure but not mixed, and the driving star flow. , God has no trace. Coupled with the change of mystery, how to resist its front? At this time, Ape Essence had found the peaks and caves of the snow mountain. First, I only paid attention to the missing, and after the leaky, wherever I was, there was a little suspicious, so I had to searches for a few days. Flying over the first time, I didn&rsquo;t feel that there was any suspiciousness on the top of the peak. After that, I remembered that there were not many snow in the upper half of the peak waist, but there was a dense cloud cluster, thinking that the enemy used Baiyun to seal the score. I wanted to hide his eyes and flew back to investigate. The ape essence is also quite careful. Because the place where the cloud seal is close to the peak, it falls under the peak and stares, but it changes with mystery, and is divided into an incarnation. You can use the opportunity to calculate from above. If you do n’t want to escape, you can also attack two times without leaving. The place where the ape was standing, the highest place at the peak corner, Lin Han looked very clear. Seeing that he flew towards the peak at the peak, he first wrapped around the peak in the air and fell to the peak. Just doubt, thinking that it is inevitable to fight a hard fight. After seeing his attention below, it seemed to have something to do, and he didn&rsquo;t even find himself, and then he let go of the snack. After a while, he listened to the strange masterpiece on the waist, and the apes were tip of Tai Yi, murmured in his mouth, and notes below, not flying. Lin Han asked Master Fen Tuo&rsquo;s help last time, and when he saw the Fengyao waist and white clouds gathered, he felt different. At that time, he was anxious to defend the apes and the prohibition of the apes, but it was not investigated in detail. It can be seen that Ape essence is quite like a white clouds for the waist peak. I thought: &ldquo;Although my own place is secret, since the ape essence is left here, I must see the shape or hear it. The hair is stopped, and it is clearly borrowed to find, and you have to worry about it. He knows that he is not mistaken for the peak waist Baiyun as his own palace? When he was young, he couldn&rsquo;t find himself there. As soon as he was found, it was said that he could be exempted from disaster. Is it a pity that he would suffer? Is it a pity? Anyway, you have to go to Master Fen Tuo. Just look at the break. If you are seen, you can also chase him to the dragon elephant. If you cast the net, the master will remove him, so as not to destroy his own palace. &quot;</p>
<p>When I changed my mind at the moment, I took the apes to myself. At the time of the following, I flew out of the pool surface and flew from the peak. Seeing that the apes seemed to have a sense of apes, he turned back because he didn&rsquo;t see people, and he was fighting tightly below. Lin Han saw that the ape essence had been refined, and except for a pair of fire eyes, his body was generally the same as people. After talking about the soul of the alien, there is no such fairy wind road in the ordinary left side of the door. Knowing that he had deep cultivation, he had to gently slowly, and he had to gently slowly, wrapped around the side, hidden into the peaceful place, and glanced out, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but be surprised. It turned out that at this time, the white clouds and the white clouds, together with the accumulated ice and snow, were all used in spells in the apes, and there was a large round hole. Quanfeng was originally standing up and down, and only the situation of Xiangyang was steep. Near the cave area is a slope. The cave is very dark, and there are only two tea cups of green light and a red light, which flickered frequently in the cave. The slope is full of stalagmites and ice, the size is different, about ten feet away from the cave. There was a Taoist standing on Bingling, dressed up, and he was generally the same as the apes. Inside the fingers, it seemed like the red light was released, and the blue light was already fighting. When Lin Han fell, he obviously saw that the ape essence used to use the flying sword, and there was this incarnation below, and he could still do the same, holding the enemy. It can be seen that the change of mystery has become wonderful. Yifa dare not care about it, prepare at any time, and a little bad, then go away.  After a while, the red light of the ape essence came out of the cave, and a very strong white gas was sprayed from the entrance of the cave. Then two o&rsquo;clock Bi Guangfei shot, rushing out of a Zhang Xu monster. The snow feathers stood up, and the body was generally the same as the hedgehog. A chicken neck is as thick as a human arm. It has three feet long and can stretch. A triangular head is as big as five buckets. There is a crown of cinnabar that is over the pointed, about about the height, lined with the white body, and it is even more bright. Dripping a pair of blue eyes, exquisite long shots, reached one or twenty feet. The face is as dark as painted, but the ears are red, such as fresh bacteria, close to the forehead. The concave nose is facing the sky, and the blood basin is also like a wide mouth. Two rows of sparse teeth are sawing. The two corners below the triangular head are its two cheeks, slightly rising, and between the puppets, there is a group of white gas spraying, gathered, and the incarnation of the ape essence. If you do n’t hit it, take a short mouth, take it back again, and spray it twice again, which is doubled. Since the appearance, it has been at the entrance of the cave and sprayed the white gas in the mouth. The apes seemed to be a little afraid of it, and they took the sword back. When the group of white gas coming, it was either rising or high, or to avoid the light of light. Wait for Bai Qi to take back, and go forward again, just to tease, without resistance. The monster only keeps the cave, and it is not forced to rush when sprayed. After spraying until later, Bai Qi sprayed bigger and bigger. The monsters were not sprayed, and they seemed to be angry. The apes are also reported by bad sounds.  Lin Han has never seen such monsters, and still refuses to leave the cave door for a step. He is just an elf like hedgehog. Looking at his two that are related to each other, you ca n’t measure what it is. Suddenly, the monster encouraged the cheeks again, spraying the group of white gas and hitting the apes, if he played nine. The apes were teased for a while, and they couldn&rsquo;t help but approach. Unexpectedly, the monster was lucky early, and it was ready to go, and the poison gas was sprayed out. This incarnation was manipulated on the top of the peak, and it seemed to know that the poison gas was so powerful in advance. It was quick to come up, and it was difficult to avoid it. Essence The monster only fled to escape, and the white gas ball ejected Xingchi. When the incarnation was approaching, it broke away and turned into countless small groups. The hail was average. A short, knowing that he was fooled, and he was busy, and he was beaten according to the original place. It was no longer there. He had to scream and accepted it back. This time, I want to be too hard, the gas group is too large, and the time of retracting does not seem to be a few times before. When the wide mouth opened, Lin Han looked at the monster&rsquo;s throat, and it seemed to have a fire. Then I realized that the apes were slow to start, and they wanted to make it sprayed out of Neidan.
When Lin Han saw the monster keeping the cave, he refused to leave.</p>
<p>He also knew that there would be some reasons.</p>
<p>He intended to see a water falling out of the stone, and he was still inside the invisible cliff and looked on the wall.</p>
<p>Because I ca n’t hear the sound of incarnation, look forward, that one acres of the ground, regardless of the ice and snow, all the places that are close to the white gas, all become dark, showing that the air sprayed by this thing is extremely poisonous.</p>
<p>The apes were afraid to fade the sword light and collected it back.</p>
<p>It was originally for this.</p>
<p>Fang was in surprise, and the apes were in the distance again, holding a lot of wood pills in their hands.</p>
<p>First make one, fight towards the monster, and one shot is a bowl of big blue light.</p>
<p>Seeing the monster&rsquo;s head, the monster still flew out the white light.</p>
<p>The second wood pill flew again, and monsters quickly sprayed the enemy.</p>
<p>It seems that this is one after another.</p>
<p>The ape essence emits twenty -one green light, and the monster will turn white into twenty -one regiments.</p>
<p>At first, Qiu Guang was too small and strong in white.</p>
<p>When he arrived, he was wrapped in it.</p>
<p>The apes were not good, and all the wood pills were flying out.</p>
<p>Baiqi wrapped the green pill, soaring the electric rotation, as if the twenty -one sun started to faint, flying up and down in the air, and the rotation was like a wheel.</p>
<p>Lin Hanzheng&rsquo;s peeping ape essence itself is still the same as before.</p>
<p>He is still at the same time as the monster.</p>
<p>He is eager to try, knowing that the monster is difficult to escape his poisonous hands.</p>
<p>It is a great thing that such evil things can be removed by fake -handed apes.</p>
<p>If you have a hatred, you will help each other.</p>
<p>The two sides fought for a while, and the apes of the apes suddenly made their hands finger, and the twenty -one reasons gradually separated.</p>
<p>The monsters didn&rsquo;t know it at first, and it was still unwilling.</p>
<p>Then the blue light flew farther and farther, and some could not know where to go.</p>
<p>The monster was in a hurry.</p>
<p>When I wanted to recycle, it was unexpected that it was easy to return to the air.</p>
<p>It was naturally easy.</p>
<p>At this time, the qi was dispersed.</p>
<p>The apes are farther and farther, and gradually hidden.</p>
<p>The glare gas in the air, the wider, and some hidden into the dark clouds, and it was almost invisible.</p>
<p>The monster was screaming in a panic, and the cheeks could not help but encourage them.</p>
<p>When they wanted to transport their strength, when they recovered, the apes were not far from appearing in front of it.</p>
<p>At the finger, the previous red light was sent out, straight towards it.</p>
<p>The monster shot, and the momentum came.</p>
<p>The monster was unexpected, and his potential could no longer be divided into poisonous gas to resist.</p>
<p>He bowed his body and yelled, his eyes stared, and he had to come out of his eyes.</p>
<p>The two blue light in the eyes immediately shot upwards, as large as a bowl of mouth, just to resist the red light, and could not fall.</p>
<p>The two sides held each other&rsquo;s meals again.</p>
<p>The blue light in the high -altitude of the four outside gradually swollen.</p>
<p>The ape essence itself was secretly used on the top of the peak.</p>
<p>When he saw that the time had arrived, his hands were in front of him.</p>
<p>The blue light under the air was slightly moved.</p>
<p>It was circularly long, the rainbow piloted, flying towards the monster, helping the red light, and attacking two times.</p>
<p>The apes are tightly applied on it; these poisonous gas groups are also stretched out of Qiuguang.</p>
<p>Without a while, it is more than half of it.</p>
<p>The gas group was originally a real Qi in the monster&rsquo;s belly, which is closely related.</p>
<p>Every time it breaks, the monsters are trembling together.</p>
<p>On the one hand, you have to use your eyes to block the enemy&rsquo;s flying sword, and you can&rsquo;t get back.</p>
<p>Seeing that those gas groups are about to explode again, and they are exhausted together.</p>
<p>He was so anxious that he had a scruple, and he dared not take risks to desperate.</p>
<p>He still supported it.</p>
<p>Later, the apes saw that those blue and red light were blocked by the monster&rsquo;s eyes, and they could not play.</p>
<p>There were still seven or eight groups in the air without breaking, and they commanded Qiuguang to break their self -qi.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a green light in each, and it will not be able to withstand.</p>
<p>In this case, the blue light flew to, and only one volume, wrapped the gas group, and it should be in the outer greenery in the inside of the inside.</p>
<p>More than twenty blue light, attacked by monsters.</p>
<p>The monsters cannot be prohibited.</p>
<p>They are extremely anxious, forced to be helpless.</p>
<p>The fierce foreplay raised, standing up, wide mouth, and a large group of fireballs flying from the throat.</p>
<p>Blue and red fly.</p>
<p>Seeing the apes on the peak, first fingered the sword light, so that they all flew down.</p>
<p>The incarnation also panicked and turned around and fled.</p>
<p>The characteristics of the monster are not critical and furious.</p>
<p>This group of Dan is never lighter; when it is sent out, it will not kill the enemy or return lightly.</p>
<p>On the occasion of hate, the danger of forgetting the interests and the dan pills in the cave.</p>
<p>When Lin Han saw the monster negatively, it was not as flexible, and he couldn&rsquo;t think of flying so fast.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it has not provoked it before, otherwise the victory will be difficult to reverse.</p>
<p>Ape essence&rsquo;s sword skills, so you can imagine it.</p>
<p>The monster just chased here, and the ape essence above the peak hidden down early, flying into the cave, and got out.</p>
<p>Lin Han looked up at the ape essence, and the incarnation flew away in the distance.</p>
<p>Fang was looking at it, listening to the apes with a long howling, and a baby with white hair like a snow in his hand, squeaking, flying out of the cave, standing on the peak, a trick, all the tricks, all the tricks, all the handles, all Qinghong Guanghua turned back from electricity.</p>
<p>The monster has chased out of the foreigner in the front, hearing the cry of the baby, knowing that the enemy was tuning to leave the mountain, scared and frightened, where can I get something else, roar, retract the Neidan, turn around, and turn around.</p>
<p>The long and powerful chicken neck, with the strange head of the triangle, raised the big red crown on his head, and moved off with four claws on the cloud.</p>
<p>The more than twenty sword light was chased after it.</p>
<p>The monster is naturally not as fast as the sword light, and in the embarrassment and panic, he just wants to go back to save the baby.</p>
<p>In the hurry, the gods are panicked, and the sword light that escapes is fake.</p>
<p>You do n’t chase it.</p>
<p>You, never thought of defense, was caught up with halfway to the circuit.</p>
<p>When the sound of flying swords behind the smelling, Fang Shi was alert, and it was no longer available.</p>
<p>More than 20 sword light fell on it together.</p>
<p>When the monster spit out Dan Yuan in the belly twice, the long feather had been swept away by Jian Guang on his body, and he almost did not cut the Zhu Guan on his head.</p>
<p>Relying on the cultivation for many years, the snow feathe hedgehog stands like an arrow, the root is like iron, which is better than the strong armor.</p>
<p>Essence Those blue light is the peach -wood sword with the remaining mountains above the mountain.</p>
<p>Although it is extracted by the elite of the Eastern Taiyi, it is not possible to fight against the fire of Dan Yang in the Dan Yang.</p>
<p>At this time, Ape Essence made monsters into a shape -shaped tire, and the vouchers that had been wins were already fucking.</p>
<p>Busy to retract the blue light, only specify the red light, surrounded by the monster&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>The monsters were not afraid, and after a while, they arrived.</p>
<p>Ape essence has long set up a trap.</p>
<p>Seeing the monster chasing, the hands were scratching the spiritual tactics, and the fingers were forward, and the ambush Taiyin Qi Gate formation began.</p>
<p>The monster saw the enemy embrace the baby and stood on the slope.</p>
<p>I just fell down, waiting to rush away.</p>
<p>Between Fang&rsquo;s anger, he saw another yellow shadow, about about acres, rising from all sides of his body, and instantly rose from the ground to the ground, reaching the top condensation.</p>
<p>Firstly, there was a big clock standing on the ground, and the top clock slowly decreased, and it seemed to be a large bowl of large bowls.</p>
<p>The monsters were buckled inside.</p>
<p>It is prohibited and cannot be moved.</p>
<p>This formation method is the puppets of Gen and Zhen in the innate eight gates, and the mountain thunder is wonderful.</p>
<p>The appearance is like covering the bowl, and there is also a leaning on the ground.</p>
<p>It really started, and the mountains of the mountains were staggered up and down.</p>
<p>It is difficult for people who escape from the top to escape from it.</p>
<p>The monsters have been banned.</p>
<p>There is a shadow on the top, non -cloud and fog.</p>
<p>It is about to press on the head.</p>
<p>The enemy is in front of it.</p>
<p>It knows not good.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t press the yellow shadow on it.</p>
<p>On the one hand, he returned to the blood pelvic mouth, bite the snow feathers on his body for more than ten roots, dumped his long neck, turned into a dozen silver arrows, shot towards the ape, and was blocked by Huang Ying and landed on the ground.</p>
<p>The apes knew that the arrow feathers were vicious, and they were not in a hurry, and they were unwilling to use it lightly.</p>
<p>When it comes to poor power, it is so stubborn and dissatisfied, it can be seen that this poison cannot be left.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help anger, and pointed at the monster and yelled: &ldquo;Damn evil beasts! Although the real person is ugly, although you are ugly in the world, because your snowy mountains are dived, the fetal baby is not solid, and you can not be fascinating. Forcing you to offer Yuan Dan, avoiding you from death. You have no choice but to regret it. If your heart is vicious, if you do n’t kill, you will be harmless. The real person will do it for heaven, except for evil, and no longer tolerate it. &quot;</p>
<p>Yiyang. First, the sound of thunder on the ground, then a snowy light, and in the yellow shadow circle, it was also a thin layer, from bottom to top, instantly permeated the entire network. As soon as it was on the top of the heart, it seemed like a fire and explosives, and it was burning, and there was a big shock. I saw the two silver snakes, the sky was flashing, and a group of thunder and hail was like a group of thunder and hail. The left near the snow mountains and Qianqian, most of them were shocked by this thunder, bombarded rumbling, corresponding to each other, the power is amazing. The monsters were bold and scared, scared, and made a ball, put all the fierce appearances before. However, it was also quite powerful. A apes flew, and the mountains were shocked.
Lin Han first listened to the apes and kissed, and he seemed to be his own life with his true immortal.</p>
<p>He forgot that his family was also an alien origin.</p>
<p>Although it was funny, these behaviors could also be gone, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but feel good.</p>
<p>I just want to use what the Fa, never show up, help him.</p>
<p>Seeing that the apes were still blocked by Neidan, the monsters were still yielding, and it was easy to kill the monster, but they thought it was Nei Dan.</p>
<p>After thinking about it, drinking and drinking: &ldquo;You are a evil animal, born vicious, harming people, it is not easy to think of you, and it is not a misfortune to be born. Give you back, go to wash your mind, and dive yourself for yourself, otherwise you will be avoided; otherwise you can prevent it, you can&rsquo;t prevent it, bad your tire, and then use the magic of the fairy family, the mines on the upper and lower Everyone is disappeared into gray smoke. See which one you take? &quot;</p>
<p>While saying, when you let out the sword light, the baby in his hand is around, making a trend of killing. These consequences kept the monster, trembled for a while, and then screamed. The ape is savvy that it means that it means that it is fooled. After Xian Dan, the baby still refuses to repay. Laughing and drinking, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a true immortal, how can I lie to you? Fortunately, I&rsquo;m not afraid that you will have a trick, you just come to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yellow shadow of that layer suddenly increased by dozens of times, from near to far to surpassing the apes, and Fang was destroyed from hidden. The monsters raised their heads, looked at the four outside, and then opened their mouths to sucked in the mouth. To escape, the Yuan fetus has fallen into a person, which is more important. He was hesitant. The apes were angry and drank: &ldquo;At this point, do you still die, do you reluctant to go to the harmful thing? If you don&rsquo;t give it out, I will start again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The monster seemed to be afraid and unfortunately. Step by step, crawling forward slowly, trembling and shaking, arrowing snow feathers on his body, squeaking. Seeing that the monster was fierce, his lips were tight, and he seemed to grit his teeth in secret, knowing not goodwill. Look at a pair of fire eyes, looking at the monster, with a smile on his face, with a very good attitude, like a voucher that will win, and the monsters are afraid of the monsters. Lin Han thought: &ldquo;The ape essence is like a strong enemy, but he has the help of Master Fen Tuo, and he has at least some dangerous difficulties. In the end, the ape essence has a good heart, otherwise the teacher would also be It won&rsquo;t help him. If the monster kills the apes, he does not know that its origin depth is depth, and it is defeated. Even if you win, it is endlessly escaped. Take a Buddhist gate to Boham Difficulty in his hand, and the ape essence drinks the monster again. The monster&rsquo;s feet walked a little faster, and the mouth squeaked in his mouth. It was still walking and shaking. At this time, due to the shock of the thunder, the snow pendant was lagging, the cold wind was prevented, and when the cold wind was in dusk, the dense clouds in the sky were low, and it was very dizzy. Lin Hanyao saw that in the dark cloud in front of him, there seemed to be a trace of half -blue and half -white, but there was no empty voice. The ape essence was concentrated on the monster, and it was not aware of it. Seeing that the monster was near, he was still climbing forward, and Fang had to drink and urged him to offer Dan. The monster deliberately spit out Neidan, just a red bead of the tea cup, slowly flying towards the apes. When the ape essence reached out to pick it up, the head of the triangle was raised, and the body shook a lot. Essence At the same time, Nine Dan also turned into a fire cloud from small to large, and it was covered under the head.  The ape essence had long guarded the monster, but he did not secretly help Lin Han. Lin Han could understand that the monster had not yet aware. When the white light and red light fell to the ground, there was no trace of enemies. Passionate recovered the inner Dan, and the four exterior yellow shadows have been from far to near, and they will come over to trap it. At the same time, Thunder&rsquo;s hair is more intense than before. The ground is also rolling, and when the ground comes out, it will break out. Suddenly, the apes appeared in front of the monster again. The monster knows that it is difficult to be a rabbit, and he has to scream twice, determined to offer Dan for life. The apes laughed and drank, &quot;</p>
<p>Do you know that I am terrible at this time? Do not extend quickly, you can still live.&rdquo; On the fingers, Huang Ying was scattered again. The monster was poor, and it was really helpless, and the red beads spit out the red beads. The apes are originally acknowledging it, how can it be released sincerely. When the bead flew up slowly, the finger finger, the yellow shadow outside the monster was reunited again, and the Neidan circuit separated. The monster was not good, just yelling at the anger, the ape essence was really spicy, raised his hands, sword light, squeezed a scream, first split the strange baby from the top to half, throw it on the spot. Essence Then rubbing with both hands, launching the thunder, the sky -high price of the earth shocked, the upper and lower gods broke together, and the monsters were shaken into crushing.  The inside Danben floated in the air, and did not wait for the apes to reach out to pick it up. In this thunderbolt, the snow and snow fluttered, and the light shot from the air. Essence When the apes saw the hand, they were taken away, and they couldn&rsquo;t help but be shocked and angry. The enemy seemed to have expected that he had long been reluctant. Here, the apes flew up, and a group of snow -like silver light blocked the road from the dark clouds opposite. The apes couldn&rsquo;t see what treasure was, and dared not care about it, busy putting all the peach and wooden swords. A red light, twenty -twenty a blue light, fighting with the silver light. Although the ape sophisticated meritorious power changes, they must not be cheap at all. It is particularly weird to try his best, and you can&rsquo;t find the trace of the enemy. Two of each other, there are about time. Suddenly, there was a woman&rsquo;s voice and said, &quot;</p>
<p>Ignorance of the beasts, such vicious Neidan, do you not want to harm others, what do you want? Otherwise, will you be my opponent? &ldquo;When you said, the silver light rose Xiaohan, and he was over the rocket, and he didn&rsquo;t fall into the Qing Dynasty. The apes were busy urging the sword to catch up, and there was no trace.</p>
