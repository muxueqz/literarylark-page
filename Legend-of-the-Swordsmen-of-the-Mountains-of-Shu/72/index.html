    <p>Seventy -first, try to try Deng Ping&rsquo;s intention to hide the adultery and ignore the ugly body, and the white -edged prostitution died.</p>
<p>When the two sides arrived at the square, the people in Daijiachang were led by Yuan Yuanqi to the Donglu sheds.</p>
<p>The people in Lucun were guided by Bai Qi accompanied by Fa Yuan and Yao Kaijiang and sent them to the Xilu shed.</p>
<p>Both the east and west sheds sent ten long -term workers to greet tea.</p>
<p>Everyone is very polite on the surface, and it is not as if you are going to fight for you.</p>
<p>When the public walked out, the monster called Hua to stand up first, and did not say hello, and walked from the outside.</p>
<p>At this time, I didn&rsquo;t know where he went.</p>
<p>Bai Qi calmed down the people of Lucun and turned around Donglu Shed.</p>
<p>At a glance, I saw that Lin Qiushui introduced the two farmers who took the talents to the table.</p>
<p>Only then did they know that the two were Wu Zhongxia Jiang Wei and Pan Xiuhu, who lived in seclusion in Jinting Mountain, Taihu Lake, Suzhou.</p>
<p>Bai Qi also met with each other.</p>
<p>It turned out that the three of Yue, Huang, and Lin saw the Gukoukou, and when they saw the nickname of the valley nickname, two people arrived far away.</p>
<p>Recently, I recognized that it was Wu Zhongxia, an old friend of the past, and went to visit Luo Xin when he came to Shanhua.</p>
<p>He heard Chu Mingqiu talk about Daijia Field, and said that the five heroes of Xiangjiang were also there, and they came to help each other.</p>
<p>I grew a few words, and saw that a flower and a big man came from the circuit.</p>
<p>Huang and Lin all believed that the big man was the land golden dragon Wei Qing, and he knew he was undercover in Lucun.</p>
<p>It is called a flower but does not recognize it.</p>
<p>Ask what Wei Qing is here first.</p>
<p>Wei Qingdao: &ldquo;My wife is in Lucun. I am afraid that Lu and Guo are doubtful and deliberately follow them to the meeting, but I asked my wife to secretly escape from the remote diameter that Girl Dai said. When I was down, I was standing not far from Fengfeng. Seeing that the peak headed towards me, I knew that I couldn&rsquo;t escape, so I had to close my eyes and wait. From the beginning, there were a hundred feet far away to keep this little life. Later, he thanked the poor master to thank him. Only then did he know that he was the new helper of Daijia Farm and knew that I was willing to save me. I told me again that my wife went wrong and was caught by a white ape and asked me to rescue me soon. He said that when I was going to be late, the white ape was going to send me a green hat. Who is a rare monkey cub. The hat of my wife is to save my wife. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, I would go. The five people of Yue, Huang, Lin, Jiang, and Pan discussed with two people to help. It is called Hua Dao: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for you to wait. Although the white ape is a little bit good, he has many roots with this Manga Han. It is best to go alone. You go and give him a mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not convinced. Lin Qiushui was the most insightful among the five heroes. Listening to Wei Qing&rsquo;s words that Hua Hua saved him, it was known that it was not an ordinary person; looking at his strange eyes, and listening to the owner of the village, he did not dare to neglect. He answered the first: &ldquo;Brother Taiwan has both the prophets, we don&rsquo;t go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wei Qingben had no interest in asking him to help five people, and heard the words hurried out of the valley.  It was called Hua Dao: &ldquo;Now people are in Qi, and there are also a good table for us. The owner sees my legs and sent me to ask you to go to eat. When I was young, my old nephew Zhang Zhang was going to come. At this time, I won&rsquo;t go. Seeing that people have withdrawn the seats, there is no seat of your seats. &quot;</p>
<p>Lin and Huang asked Hua to call him Master Danu. Zhang Zhang was him. The old wise nephew, he was short of two generations immediately. I also want Master to separate from Taiwan Island. I have never been in the mountains for many years. How can I come here today? Seeing him crazy, I do n’t know if it ’s true or false, so I had to stand up to sullen and asked,&rdquo; The predecessors are familiar with their family teachers. Brother is also good. &quot;</p>
<p>Hua Hua said with a smile:&rdquo; Is Xiao Zhanger your master? If you want to ask my name, I will name the poor god, there are no names. If you look down on me, you can call me poor gods, or the name of me is called flowers. &quot;</p>
<p>Huang and Lin heard the words and doubt the letter, but the strange name of the flower was familiar. I couldn&rsquo;t think of him. The origin, estimation is not to wait for the idle. Also waiting to be tested, Wu Zhongshuangxia has always been stable, but it is not very good. Yue Dapeng was already impatient and said, &ldquo;This poor master said that the enemy has arrived, and the owner waits for me to enter the meeting. It&rsquo;s so good. &quot;</p>
<p>The strange said that Huahaha laughed:&rdquo; What he said to me, I was hungry in the morning, and it was just right to eat it. &quot;</p>
<p>Usually go forward. The strange calling Hua sneered, and yelled at the back: &ldquo;You go slowly, I am a few years old, I can&rsquo;t help but look at your master&rsquo;s division, wait for me to wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Broken straw shoes rushed behind. Huang, Lin, and other five people could not hear them, and still ran forward. After a while, they could not hear the shouts. They knew that they were far apart. Everyone was angry and funny. Although Lin Qiushui moved with the four people, he thought: &ldquo;This person can not even be light -fitting, and the owner invites him to come to do it? Besides, Wei Qing is a person who will not say. What&rsquo;s more, why is it so bad? Is it intention to make it intentionally? &quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly, the stranger ran out of the inside: &ldquo;Your legs are fast, but you will not be familiar with our road, you will copy the road, and you will come one step first than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way, I was shocked, and they all changed their thoughts. It was not easy to understand the words, so I had to agree vaguely. Hua Hua said, &ldquo;The owner invites you five people to go in, and go to the seat to eat and drink, don&rsquo;t talk more. I follow you behind the five of you. You must not mention my origin and pay attention to scaring the rabbits away. Looking for them. &quot;</p>
<p>Huang and Lin five were only unique. After entering, it really goes as he said. That&rsquo;s called Hua Sit in the chief, eating and drinking. Saicai catching snakes, the smell of the dirty hand that caused him, and others didn&rsquo;t realize what happened. Wherever Yue Dapeng swallowed, he just looked at Lin Qiushui and dared to say. Lin Qiushui didn&rsquo;t care, but persuaded himself. Blame Hua Dao: &ldquo;You are funny, and you are not here to save you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although Lin Qiushui didn&rsquo;t understand the purpose, he knew that this fight today is unusual, and this person must be tight. As soon as the seat was scattered, Lin Qiushui followed him closely. He tentatively tentatively tested it several times. I met Bai Qi and said it slightly. I heard that Master Yu Qing attached so much attention to him, and the more he felt that his eyesight was not bad. It was only too time to ask Master Yuqing. He and Master Tanzha roar Zhang Zhang is He Yuanyuan.  Bai Qi talked with everyone a few words, and Yuan Yuanqi ordered him to compete for the first place. Bai Qi led him, and first from the shed to the first lotus pile, he lifted his breath and used a golden chicken independent posture. At this time, it was the weather in early February. The spring light was bright, the flowers on the hillside were blooming, the peach red willow is green, and the wind is slow. Bai Qiren was handsome and wore a white strong man&rsquo;s crown. He stood on the lotus pile and made a filament. He asked Chen Changtai to answer the name of the Xilu shed. It is indispensable for his attitude, and the heroic posture is unable to live. Seeing Bai Qi on the west shed, Bai Qi appeared, and said loudly to Yuan Yuanqi: &ldquo;The talented talent is better than martial arts, and the Baizhuang master is proficient in spells. When he was in Yu Shendong, he had already taught. If you are better than spells first, wait for the poor monks and Bai Zhuang to be short -term. &quot;</p>
<p>Yuan Yuan heard the words, and then remembered that Fa Yuan was due to the breaking law of the fish god cave. Bai Qi would also spell. I did not get up, and quickly answered: &ldquo;The Zen Master is slow! The Poor Tao only knows that the martial arts of the Baizhuang owner internally and outside the outside world are all overwhelming, but I do n’t know that he is also proficient in the law. Since the Zen master is suspicious, I will return to him, and change to another place. Going forward and led by. &quot;</p>
<p>Saying, he went back to Bai Qi with Dai Hengyu. This method of crossing the water and flying in the sand was originally familiar with Bai, Dai, and Xu. Heng Yu got up and took his body towards the shed. It happened that Bai Qi returned. At this time, the two greeted each other, and they saw that the two of them would be biased, and they all passed by. Essence When Bai Qi arrived on the stage, Heng Yu also stood calmly on the lotus pile, which made a fish eagle tirelessly standing, and the sound of the west reed shed: &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chen Changtai in the Xilu shed said that he would not this. You have never seen it without seeing it. Luo Jiushi only met Yuan Yuanqi. Although he had worshiped under the door of Fa Yuan, there were three fears, and he did not dare to go out in the first battle. Chen Changtai saw Hengyu&rsquo;s call, and took his eyes straight at him. I can&rsquo;t say that I can&rsquo;t say, I have to get up. Looking at the stage, I saw these three lotus piles, a sandy embankment, and a knife embankment. They were not internal and external. At the moment, he said to Fa Yuan: &ldquo;The disciples will go to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Heng Yu saw Luo Jiu, he didn&rsquo;t dare to neglect. He stood on the lotus pile and arched his hands on the opposite side, and said, &ldquo;Please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he put himself on the sand embankment. As soon as the toes were in the sand embankment, their hands were separated, and they moved to the upper end of the waist to stabilize the sinking power. They used the kung fu of Deng Ping to cross the water. Although Luo Jiu did not fly on the grass, the person who had practiced swordsmanship in the end, Qigong was very foundation. Seeing the yellow sand like snow, he piled into a sandy embankment with a tip of the top. Slowly, it was a human, that is, the birds walked over on it, and they couldn&rsquo;t leave the footprints. He had to move his body, hold your body, walk on the sand with his virtuality, and actually go to the lotus pile of the sandy embankment.
Tong Yuan Qi Mingbai and Dai saw the first array.</p>
<p>It was nothing more than because Bai, Dai, and Xu were the main body.</p>
<p>Man was named Chen Changtai, but he didn&rsquo;t want to change Luo Jiu.</p>
<p>Knowing that Heng Yu martial arts is good, he will not be swordsmanship, and it is by no means Luo Jiu&rsquo;s enemy.</p>
<p>But it was already on the spot.</p>
<p>Luo Jiu&rsquo;s unreasonable sword was put away.</p>
<p>If the sword was in a hurry, he went to put him the result.</p>
<p>He was thinking in his heart.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the master Yuqing said: &ldquo;Ling Ling appeared in front of the stage again. We will win today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Yuan Qi heard that he looked forward, he leaned at the strange flower that was seen by the talented talent, but the pillar he rely on was blocking the eyes of the Xilu shed, and he couldn&rsquo;t help nod.  At this time, Heng Yu had opposite Luo Jiu, and explained two words on the rivers and lakes, and went to the knife embankment. Luo Jiujue&rsquo;s knife embankment is much easier than the sandy embankment. He sneered and went up. Both of them walked like flying, and they had all walked for a while. Heng Yu was on the lotus pile, and he was about to &ldquo;please&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luo Jiun Gong&rsquo;s hand, and went to the ring. Suddenly, the lotus pile of Luo Jiu Station suddenly turned down and fell Luo Jiu to the ground. Luo Jiuzheng was about to be fierce, and his Yuan Qi and Fa Yuan flew from the east and west reed sheds. As soon as he greeted Heng Yu back, he said loudly: &ldquo;The first victory or defeat has been divided. Please send another part to the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luo Jiu saw that Yuan Yuanqi arrived, in the end, there were three points of fear. Go back to Xilu shed. From the beginning of Fa Yuan, Luo Jiu suddenly fell down the lotus pile and was very surprised. Seeing that Yuan Yuanqi flew out, he hurriedly followed. As soon as I heard that Yuan Yuanqi spoke, I didn&rsquo;t say it first, hurriedly picked up the broken lotus pile underground, and picked up the lotus pile on Hengyu, and looked at it. I saw that these two lotus piles were inserted in the soil virtually. The things were generally there. When you look at the two -sided knife embankment, it is also generally inserted inside the floating soil. It&rsquo;s just that Luo Jiu has passed as well as new; Heng Yu&rsquo;s blade was rolled out, and he was half -cut, but he was not skewed. The hidden power hidden in this kind of light work is really rare. Even if the lotus pile did not fall, Luo Jiu had lost a level. However, since Luo Jiu was secretly controlling his sword and walking on his body, why would he break the lotus pile? Obviously, others calculated. However, you can&rsquo;t see some signs, it is better to admit defeat. Then he said to Yuan Yuanqi: &ldquo;Luo Jiuyi didn&rsquo;t pay attention to it at a time, and he lost.  Tong Yuanqi said: &quot;</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s events, they originally said that each of them was fighting according to their own skills. The poor way of seeking the poverty of the talent, because seeing the Baizhuang owner is the main body, so he ordered him to play. Instructed to teach with the master of Chen Zhuang, want to teach the subjects of both parties to see a victory and defeat, and then the guests invite by the two sides to appear. Who knows that the Zen master teaches Luo Jiu to come up. Knowing swordsmanship. Poor Dao also knows that the owner of the Dai Zhuang is not an opponent, but he has already appeared, and he retreats when he encounters strong. As long as Luo Jiu does not lean on the swordsmanship, he has been forced to die. Unexpectedly, Luo Jiu was in the past. Under the poor door, I thought that learning swordsmanship can be invincible, and for the volatile of martial arts. When I arrived at the sandy embankment, I used the method of controlling gas to fly, and I dare not stick to the sand. In the pre -method, I do n’t know the soft and hard work of Deng Ping&rsquo;s water crossing the water and the knife. The sand must not be dusty, leaving no traces; the knife must not move. Qualified. The knife does not fold the blade and has lost one; at the end, he does not pay attention to break the lotus piles. If the non -poverty -catching machine comes, he will use the flying sword to be bullied. It shows Gao Ming. However, the first game was better than martial arts. This time, the personnel affairs were dispatched, and the rules were exempted from the rivers and lakes. &quot;  Fa Yuan was ridiculed, and he could not help but hate his teeth. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>You must be reasonable to rest, you will tell you what we are amazing!&rdquo; Turn around the reed shed, and first call Luo Jiu to ask how to fall. Luo Jiudao: &quot;</p>
<p>As soon as the disciples went up, they used the method of controlling the sword and lightly, and they never stained the embankment. When I reached the end of the knife embankment, I just went to the lotus pile. After being pulled by a person to pull his feet, he fell down. &ldquo;Fa Yuan also knew that although Luo Jiu would not cross the water, he would not fall down from the pile anyway. Guess the enemy secretly made him bad, and asked him to lose his ugliness in public. When he asked Luo Jiu, he saw what kind of trace, and Luo Jiu answered nothing. Fa Yuan knew that he couldn&rsquo;t give the theory to others, so he had to hate in his heart.  This time, the Xilu shed sent someone to appear, and Fa Yuan asked anyone to go first. At the moment, Liu Yanniang&rsquo;s brother Pink Peony passed through Yunyan Liu Xiong flying up and made a response: &quot;</p>
<p>Disciples are willing to go.&rdquo; Fa Yuan knew that he had practiced light work, because Luo Jiu was secretly calculated, and he repeatedly told Liu Xiongfei to pay attention. At the same time, I use my eyes to set the two embankments, ready to see some movements, and then theory with the enemy. At this time, the lotus pile in front of the stage had been replaced by Bai Qi. When Yuan Yuanqi saw that Liu Xiongfei came out, he said to everyone: &quot;</p>
<p>The coming person is a famous king thief on the Xichuan Road. Who would like to meet him?&rdquo; Yellow and Liu were separated from the east -west reed sheds to the sandy embankment and reached the lotus pile. Liu Xiongfei asked the other party&rsquo;s name. He knew that he was one of the five heroes of the Xiangjiang River. He didn&rsquo;t dare to neglect. He arched his hand, stepped on the knife embankment, and walked to the ends of the lotus pile. Two times came to the stage, everyone took out the weapons and put the portal and handed it up. Huang Renyu made a nine -cutting sky, and Liu Xiongfu made the chain grab. As soon as he played against it, Huang Renyu put a scafen and nodded towards Liu Xiong. Liu Xiongfei saw that Huang Renyu was a short blade. His chain was long, and he felt that he could take advantage of it. Seeing that Huang Renyu was in the sky, he put his feet a little bit, and turned backwards, but secretly grabbed the left hand chain at the same time. When Huang Renyu saw the chain grabbing his head, he was not panicked and aimed at the grabbing head. As soon as he was scratching, Liu Xiongfei&rsquo;s right hand grabbed and sent out. Huang Renyu saw Liu Xiongfei grab this pair of chain to make the pen tube straight, like a storm of wind and rain, thinking: &quot;</p>
<p>This is not weak, but unfortunately it is too unreasonable, and teach him to die under my scapep. . &ldquo;The martial arts of the Wuxia of the Xiangjiang River practiced the Tai Chi Biao Kung Fu, which made the short weapons. Specializing in static braking, the more the enemy&rsquo;s blade became more and more disadvantaged. Liu Xiong did not notice it at the beginning, and later saw that he would go out when he was arrested. If you don&rsquo;t move your body, take the two heads of the sky, and then swing away. Sometimes the power is a little bigger, and Liu Xiongfei is painful. Knowing the enemy, the more careful you are. After playing for a while, I saw that the enemy only destined to himself, not turning, and calm when you caught it. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>When will it be over like this? Obviously the enemy wants to exhaust his strength, and then send a move.&rdquo; Seeing that there is a loss and winning, in a hurry, I can&rsquo;t help but play an idea: deliberately pretend to be exhausted, and the tricks are scattered. , Want to seduce Huang Renyu into the move. There is no reason that Renyu has passed through the enemy. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>I want you to live more for a while, you want to sell it in front of me. It is better to send you back early and clean up the other party.&rdquo; Thinking of this, it happened that Liu Xiongfei flew his left hand and sold a false trick. , Sweep the right hand and scan the lower three roads; at the same time, the left hand grasps from virtual change, so that the solution of a dead tree plate root is hit. Huang Renyu shouted, &quot;</p>
<p>Good come!&rdquo; He stepped back and half a step back. The enemy&rsquo;s double grasping fell at the same time. Liu Xiongfei saw that she had a double grabbing and knew that it was not good. I just wanted to move the rod, recovered their strength, and changed the tricks. Just listening to Dang Dang, nodded by Huang Renyu&rsquo;s head. When I immediately felt that the mouth of the tiger opened, I couldn&rsquo;t hold it, and shouted, &quot;</p>
<p>Not good!&rdquo; I was in an urgent Shengzhong, and I got up and took a long distance. It was to make the best tricks that wins the losing defeat. Looking at Huang Renyu is standing ahead, it is still nothing to do. The long worker prepared on the stage came forward and took Liu Xiong to Xilu Shed. It is said that Liu Xiongfei&rsquo;s light work has really reached the top, and his skills were very agile when he retreated, and he never heard it at all. But after all, Huang Renyu was chased down, and Xiangjiang Five Xia skills were visible here. All the people at the Xilu sheds gritted their teeth and hated. Looking at Huang Renyu again, it has already stepped down and turned around to Donglu shed. When the long worker took Liu Xiong to take a look at it, he thought he was rescued first, and to look at Liu Xiongfei&rsquo;s wounds. He had been reunited by Huang Renyu on the dead acupoint.
Liu Yanniang fiercely made a mistake in Yinya, and did not invite the French Yuan.</p>
<p>As soon as the Xilu shed flew, he went to the ring.</p>
<p>In Zhang Kuang, he heard a tender and said in his ears: &ldquo;The thieves are not trustworthy, arbitrarily mad! He Mei is coming!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were not yet, and Donglu shed was a woman in black. Liu Yanniang knew that there were a lot of nemesis on the opposite side, only because of revenge and forgetting the danger. After speaking on the stage, I remembered that there were Wu Wenqi, Zhou Qingyun, etc. opposite the opposite enemies, and they were so embarrassed, but the words had been sent out. Before that, he heard a woman answering and couldn&rsquo;t help but startled. To meet, the woman who came was not Wu and Tuesday, and they were slightly more attentive. I thought: &ldquo;There are many people on the opposite side, unless France and Yao Kaijiang can win, the rest of the people may not be able to live. Mo Ru sent the woman back and fish for a face to turn around the Xiangjiang River. &quot;</p>
<p>The idea has been determined, but I can&rsquo;t worry, and asked,&rdquo; The coming people can get out of the injury. Do you know that the nine -tailed fairy fox will Liu Yanniang is powerful? &quot;</p>
<p>He Mei laughed:&quot; I know that you are a cheap prostitute. Take your dog life! &quot;</p>
<p>Said, two hands and a point, which made a jade girl&rsquo;s boxing standing position, set off the portal, and said,&quot; Please! &quot;</p>
<p>As the right palm shook on Liu Yanniang&rsquo;s face, he got up and got up. Left palm, force to split Huayue, hit the head. Liu Yanniang saw He Meibu&rsquo;s method of lightness, exquisite in the palm of the hand, and not neglecting. She first made a portal. Seeing He Mei&rsquo;s palm, he was busy using the tricks of the beam pillar, and the palm of the palm went up alone. He Mei shouted, &ldquo;Good come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning his left palm towards the left, instead of penetrating into the inner circle from below, and. At the same time, her right palm turned down, and she opened Yan Niang&rsquo;s fist. She also went to Yan Niang&rsquo;s wrist, and she scattered Yan Niang&rsquo;s hands at the same time, breaking the tricks, and the portal opened. Not to be able to return to Yan Niang&rsquo;s hands, and when she moved forward, on the occasion of one minute, a fairy crane was soothing, turned her legs side by side, and went to Yan Niang&rsquo;s chest. Yan Niang was unexpectedly changed so endlessly that He Mei&rsquo;s palm method was so endless, but she retreated quickly. She was swept a little on her waist and eyes by He Mei. She had felt very painful. The gossip cactus that has not been used for many years will come out, fight with He Mei, wave the wrist with Hao, and flipping up and down. It happened that the two had the same idea: Everyone had suffered a loss of the sword. I didn&rsquo;t know the enemy&rsquo;s reality, and no one was willing to release the sword. In less than dozens of rounds, Liu Yanniang didn&rsquo;t know how much danger and how much they had eaten. Seeing that He Mei did not have a blade on her body, the more she guess she must have a calendar, and she did not dare to make it. Later, he was tightened by He Mei, so he had to grit his teeth to hold his heart fiercely. He Mei has long been guarded and shakes his body and puts on the flying sword. Each person uses the spirit to make the two sword light twisted. Yan Niang saw that the enemy&rsquo;s flying sword was not weak, and the more he was shocked.  In the critical occasion, the Xue Python was broken on the Xilu shed. It turned out that he was blinded by Zhu Wen at the Campaign of Ciyun Temple, and there was only one of the false eyes left with a pair with the right eye. She avenge herself. Meet Liu Yanniang halfway, and the two hooked up as temporary couples and were very loving. At this time, when Yan Niang was in critical condition, she didn&rsquo;t ask the green soap and white, and when she patted it behind her head, there was a blue light flying up. Huang Xuan met in Donglu Shed, and he also released the flying sword to welcomes the enemy. After a while, the rules were chaotic. First, Kong Lingzi, Cao Fei, Yu Jigu, Lu Xianming, Guo Yunzheng, and Mao Tai flew forward and released the sword light. Last week, the three female heroes of the light Yun, Wu Wenqi, and Cui Qi of the Donglu shed, and Yu Shunnong, who was the same as the Tiebi Taoist, and the five heroes in the Xiangjiang River, welcomed the flying sword. Seeing that the enemy did not agree in advance, it was randomly killed. He was busy calling Bai Qi Tong Ling Cao Weng Yu, Dai Hengyu, Yue Dapeng, Huang Renyu, Huang Renyu, Xu Chao, Brother Zhang Qi, Ling Yunfeng, Dai Xiangying. live. Because Yuan Yuanqi and Master Yuqing used the whole god to see the Fa Yuan and Yao Kaijiang, who was afraid that the group of thieves on the opposite side would be disturbed by the villagers when they were busy with the sword. Knowing that the wooden chickens and Lin Qiushui in the five Xia and Lin Qiushui of the Xiangjiang River would have the swordsmanship, they ordered the sword light to separate Bai Qi, so as to prevent the swordsmanship of the swordsmanship in the opposite group. Bai Qi waited to scatter the front of the square. Sure enough, the thieves on the Xilu sheds rushed down, and Judu rushed to Daijiamen to rush over. At the same time, Fasun also released the flying sword, and Yao Kaijiang also released the refined flying knife. Dozens of red silk and three green light flew towards the east reed shed. Master Yu Yuanqi and Yu Qing did not dare to neglect. This battle is very lively. There are flying sword light in the air, and the five colors are colorful and the golden light shines.  When Luo Jiu saw that Yuan Yuanqi was present, he didn&rsquo;t dare to step forward. Suddenly, when he saw that Yuan Yuanqi lived in the Fa Yuan, he did not have to be fascinated. At this time, the two sides were almost evenly matched. Except for He Mei to host Liu Yanniang on the ring, Huang Xuanje hosted the three -eyed red neon Xue Python, Zhou Qingyun lived in Kong Lingzi, Wu Wenqi lived in Cao Fei, Cui Qi lived in Yuci Valley , Yu Shunnong&rsquo;s enemy lived in Lu Xianming, and the Tieyu Dao people doubled Guo Yunzheng and Mao Tai. When Luo Jiu saw Cui Qi welcoming Yuci Valley, he seemed to be struggling, and quietly told Yao Suxiu that he wanted to go out and help Yu Jigu in addition to Cui Qi. At this time, Cui Qizheng&rsquo;s enemy Yu Jigu couldn&rsquo;t fall, and suddenly he saw that two Huang Guang flew towards himself on the enemy. When God was scattered, the sword light of Yuci Valley became more powerful. At the same time, Luo Jiu and Yao Suxiu&rsquo;s sword light also flew towards Cui Qi. Master Yuqing welcomed the enemy Yao Kaijiang. She suddenly saw that Cui Qi was attacked by the enemy and was in danger. Suddenly, Fa Yuan flashed the stranger of the talent behind him. When he appeared, he hit Fayuan&rsquo;s big mouth. He scolded: &ldquo;Everyone tells one on one of the one, not to be two dozens of dozen. Female doll. &quot;</p>
<p>Let’ s fight, his feet and one vertical, actually faster than the sword. He caught up with the sword light of Luo Jiu and Yao Suxiu. He only grabbed it with his hands and grabbed it in his hand and rubbed it for a while to turn it into a meteor. Another vertical, even in the sword light, grabbing Guo Yunzhang&rsquo;s sword light first, saying, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t allow two dozens of dozen, you have two dozen one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>: &ldquo;This sword is not bad, but unfortunately a bit evil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Say, throw Guo Yun&rsquo;s flying sword to the northwest corner, saying, &ldquo;Old beggar, you keep it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everyone on the reed sheds saw this tattered flying in the sword light. If there was no one in the situation, only the two hands were grasped, and they took three flying swords, but they were so scared that they were so scared. Well. Fortunately, when he received three flying swords, he stopped his hand and fell to the ground. He said loudly, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t rush to kill, just don&rsquo;t allow you to two doers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly, Yuan saw that Yuan saw his heart, and even the person in Yuqing and the person who knew him in his foundation felt that the publicity was extraordinary after all. Listening to his mouth calling the old beggar to pick up his sword, he thought to himself, &ldquo;It is not his wife to participate, let alone the enemy&rsquo;s aspect.&rdquo;</p>
