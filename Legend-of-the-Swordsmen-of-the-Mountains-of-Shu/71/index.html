    <h1>Seventy -10 times broken snake -moving mountains Poor gods, the birth of the spring</h1>
    <p>Seventy -10 times broken snake -moving mountains Poor gods, the birth of the spring  Bai Qi rushed to the entrance of Yu Shen Cave, and Tianguang Industry had already died at noon.</p>
<p>I want to find a hidden place to hide, and wait for the enemy to appear again.</p>
<p>I just walked behind a rock, and suddenly saw a beautiful and ugly called Huazi, and fell asleep on the stone.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t pay attention first.</p>
<p>I just wanted to find another mountain stone and sat down, and suddenly listened to the mouth of the flower murmur and said, &ldquo;What a bold thing, I really dare to come here alone. I caught you to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bai Qi heard the words and moved in my heart. Understand: &ldquo;The talent is light and cloudy, and a flower son has been found here. In recent years, the whole Hunan is very good, and the people have lived in peace. Where are the flowers in the mountains? This man is suspicious. . &quot;</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I saw this flower son talking about dreams, rolled over and sat up, raised his right hand, grabbed a big snake like a rough arms, his head was long, his eyes were red, fine and light, seven or eight inches long, seven or eight inches long Shinzi spit out, and sprayed the poisonous mist in direct flowers, and was willing to be willing to be willing. The seven inches of the snake have been hurriedly by the flower son, and they must not move. The snake wanted to be very angry. He moved up his body, and he stretched two or three feet of snake body after a large stone sitting by the flower. When it was just stretched out, the body was generally straight, and the color pattern reflected the daylight, just like a color pillar. Speaking of time, at that time, when Bai Qi was shocked for a moment, the snake was standing upright with her lower body, and the wind was also ill. Roll it straight to the flower of the flower, surrounded the flower son several turns, turned to the long tail to the flower son to the flower son. Stab on the face. When Bai Qi was not good, he was about to pull forward, and the flower son shouted, &ldquo;Good guy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His pair of arms that were tightly beams of snake, somehow competing out, his left hand was still holding snake heads, his right hand was already in his right hand, and his right hand had already been. Grab the tail of the snake. Although the snake tied the body of Huazi, the head and tail had been lost. On the one hand, he went to the flower son, and sprayed the poisonous mist at the Hua Zi. The flower of the flower and the snake looked at each other, and it was not instantly. Bai Qi has felt that this flower son is very people, and is about to move forward. That Huazi stared at his eyes, as if he was desperate with the snake and couldn&rsquo;t speak. Seeing that Bai Qi was closer, he shook his right hand with a snake tail. His eyes rushed to fire, and he shed a sip, his arms were cheered, and the snake body had been broken for several halves and fell underground. The flower was a bit tired, stood up, and played the soil on the body. The hundred quail clothes worn on the body were twisted by the strange snake, and the karma has been twisted into pieces, hanging in the east, and a piece of west, revealing the dark chest and back, as dark and bright like iron. The flower was full of ignorance, and he didn&rsquo;t even look at Bai Qi with his eyes, and walked lazily towards the rock side.  Bai Qi was about to catch up and ask for advice. The sound of firecrackers came from the side of Yu Shendong. As soon as he hesitated, he suddenly arrived in He Mei. He met and said, &ldquo;The enemy industry has got up from Lucun. Master Yuqing asked me to ask Bai Ye to wait in front of the cave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just in the moment when Bai Qi and He Mei spoke, looking back at Huazi, the karma was gone. Bai Qi had no time to do this. He had to fly to Yu Shendong and ran. Fortunately, not far away, he arrived in a while. At the entrance of the cave, because the top of the cave had been revealed, it was very obvious. Just listen to the sound of firecrackers, there is no movement. After a while, I saw more than twenty people, different costumes, and monks and vulgarity. Four people: a monk, a Taoist, one wearing very gorgeous clothes, and a very special wear. Gradually approached, only the fourth person was seven feet tall and wore his shoulders. A golden hoop on the forehead. The upper body was wearing a deer skin as a half -arm, exposing a right arm with five poisonous patterns on it. There is a bunch of copper ring hanging in the waist, a Burmese knife with a sheath. There are long crossbow boxes on the back. There was also a beast skin around the waist, and no beasts were seen. A pair of purple legs exposed naked, there are many pine fat gravel on the top, and there are many strange patterns. Noodles are like golden paper, and long noodles are pointed. Both eyes were round and big, and the green was fierce. The nostrils are facing the sky, and the concave will go down. The two tips of the ears are biased. One wide mouth is three inches wide, long -haired long neck, and some golden circle hangs on both ears and necks. The appearance is very mighty. Bai Qi knows that this person must be Yao Kaijiang. Seeing him behind him, there were two people who were pretending to be, but he was not tall and mighty.  This group of people walked about two or three feet away from Bai Qi, and Bai Qi went forward and went forward. I suddenly saw a tall man from the group of people. Said loudly: &ldquo;The land of the land, Jinlong Wei Qing, worshiped Lucun Village, and the lives of Luo Han and heroes. Cambodian post, replied with a smile: &quot;</p>
<p>Bai Qi, the owner of the house in the next family, the owner of the Montgantic Village does not give up. When you come, you are waiting here. It was Bai Qi, which made a look. Turn back, say Bai Qi&rsquo;s words to those who are led by. Bai Qi also greeted him and said, &ldquo;Which one is the Lord of Luzhuang? Please meet each other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gorgeous man stepped forward and answered: &ldquo;Lower Lu Xianming. Bai Qi replied: &quot;</p>
<p>It is the next. The village is adjacent to Guicun. Since that year, the mountains and rivers have collapsed. In this way, for Jiu Yang&rsquo;s heroes, I can use this to teach. The Mongolian owner and everyone Hui Ran are really good! But although they are running on the rivers and lakes, only because of their youthful learning, they are not deep in the WTO. For Most of you have never seen you in the same time. I do n’t know if Shang Qizhuang Lord is introduced. &ldquo;Lu Xianming heard the words and sneered:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most of them are the reality of the swordsman and hero of the swordsman who have enjoyed the name for a long time. I have never seen it, just staying in the next thing. &ldquo;Saying, he pointed at the monk:&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the teacher of the Wutai Swordsman Golden Body Luo Hanfa. &quot; The first Swordsman Yao Kaijiang, the first spell of Xinjiang. &quot;</p>
<p>Bai Qilian said,&rdquo; Fortunately, &quot;</p>
<p>and it is not allowed to perfunctory. Fa Yuan and Yao Kaijiang did not say a lot. Bai Qi only cares about it. In addition to Chen and Luo, they ask the other people to ask for advice. Sure enough, there were several Jiangyang thieves and picked flowers, and Bai Qi remained silent. Scribe a few words at will, and invite the leading way in front, and walk with Lu Xianming.
Go all the way forward, and estimate that there are about half a multi -way way out of the way.</p>
<p>We deliberately used words to tease Lu Xianming: &ldquo;Our two villages are adjacent to each other, and there is a hindrance to Yu Shendong. Since the past few days ago Come in from Qiancun Gankou, but Unexpectedly, the fish Shendong opened for no reason. The three brothers were too late because they were notarized, so they were divided into two ways to greet them. I did n’t want the owner to copy the road. The old road has been opened. But I often ask. &quot;</p>
<p>Lu Xianming laughed:&rdquo; I teach the owner of Baizhuang to laugh. I waited for the customer to fly to Guicun from the air. Master Yao used Liuding to open the old road to open up the old road. It was cheaper and we took a lot of way. &quot;</p>
<p>Bai Qi laughed:&rdquo; It turned out to be Master Yao&rsquo;s mana, it was really wonderful! But today, half of the matter is asking the owner to ask the owner Come here to lectures and claims with Chen Village and Chen Yanzhuang. I am afraid that the average villagers will not know the truth. In case of the end of the banquet, they will go in and out of Yu Shendong. According to the following opinions, Mo Ru temporarily blocked the old road of Yu Shendong. How can you send you back and send it back? &quot;</p>
<p>Then, Lu Xianming also said that he finged forward, only listening to Yin Yinlei for a while Voice. Everyone looked back and looked at the peaks that Yao Kaijiang used the demon method for half a day, and slowly pressed the old road of Yu Shendong. Yao Kaijiang&rsquo;s method of Liu Ding Kaishan did not get home. It was erected with the mountain peaks with the demon method, and then supported by the evil god from the side. At this time, Master Yuqing and Bai Qi followed the agreed method. Bai Qi pointed forward, and Master Yuqing used the Fa -rectification to drive away the evil gods, broke the demon method, and then used the spell to make the one hundred feet lonely peak slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slowly slow Slow down. The people of Lucun saw Bai Qi break through Yao Kaijiang&rsquo;s demon, and he was shocked. Especially Yao Kaijiang has never met an opponent since his birth. What else is there in this Dai family? Who knows that after getting up to open Yu Shendong&rsquo;s hometown this morning, after a while, he felt God. First of all, I thought it was quickly rewarded, and I never worked hard. I hurriedly found a quiet room, and used my efforts. Somehow, a mind is always unable to hold back, and even the calculation is not spiritual. Although I feel that there is a good sign of ominous, I am still confident that the spells are strong and have not taken the enemy to heart. I barely calculated the Nikko Shengke, knowing that it was the best at noon, and until noon, then it took the place. After passing the old road of Yu Shendong, I saw that there was only one person in Daijiachang. Seeing that Bai Qi was not mighty, he looked more in his heart. This time, when he saw that he did not chant the curse, he only finged his hand, and he broke the spell, ashamed and angry in front of everyone. At the moment, I didn&rsquo;t say anything, and secretly made the monster command the demon god step forward, trying to lift the peak. His demon law was amazing. He actually pushed the peaks in the air, and he couldn&rsquo;t get up. Lu Xianming knew that it was Yao Kaijiang Shi, and then turned his worries, and said with a smile to Bai Qi: &ldquo;Baizhuang&rsquo;s masterpiece is really magical. However, the mountain peak hangs in the air, but stops falling. The loss of words is a trivial matter. If the mountain peak suddenly falls, there must be many people and many people. Wouldn&rsquo;t there be the original heart of the owner who lost Bai Zhuang to protect the villagers? &quot;</p>
<p>Bai Qi saw the mountain peak hanging in the middle, as if he was held by something, the bold was stalemate. I couldn&rsquo;t do it, and I don&rsquo;t know if Master Yuqing was the enemy of Yao Kaijiang. When I turned around, I saw that behind the stones in the woods next to it, the name of the snake -captured snake was standing by the talented talent, and it was scratching towards the peak from a distance. Bai Qi didn&rsquo;t know what the origin of Huazi was a hatred or friend. It is a pity that Shi has no chance to talk to him. Suddenly, he listened to Lu Xianming&rsquo;s sarcasm and became more anxious. When he was embarrassed, suddenly a light flashed in front of him, Master Yuqing appeared and said, &ldquo;Everyone goes quickly, pays attention to the mountain peaks, and suffer by mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you wear it out, he shouted, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the crowd turned around, I saw that Hua Zi would wave his hand, and immediately there would be a big thunderbolt out of the sky, and then he heard the sound of the landslide earthquake. Everyone looked at the place where they set out, and they had already moved out of the land. It was not far away from the Dai family. Looking back at Yu Shendong, the sand and stones are flying, the red dust is covered, and the sunlight is dark. Many weird bull ghosts and snake gods faintly see it. Looking for the right thing, it is called Huazi, and the trace is gone. Yao Kaijiang was greatly reduced. Fa Yuan saw that Master Yuqing also came here, hate and anxious, and did not know who the Emei faction was present. At this point, I had to get forward hard, and then talk about it.  At this time, the square was near, and Heng Yu and Xu Chao welcomed them. They had to say a politely and welcomed everyone in. Tong Yuanqi led everyone to wait in the lobby, and all the swordsmen outside also entered the inside together. Seeing that the Emei faction was not much of the main characters, Fa Yuan could not help but smile, but smiled, and stepped forward to say hello to Master Yu Yuanqi and Yu Qing. Both parties have not recognized them, and both are introduced by Bai Qi, Dai Hengyu, Lu Xianming, and Guo Yunzhang, and then they are located in the guests. The first table of the chairman is the seven of Wanli Feihong Yuanqi, Tieyu Taoist, Master Yuqing, Zhao Xinyuan, Huang Xuanji, Bai Qi, and Ling Cao. Seven people in Yu Yunzhong, Xu Chao, and Zhang Qi; the third table was He Mei, Cui Qi, Wu Wenqi, Zhou Qingyun, Zhang Yaoqing, Ling Yunfeng, and Dai Xiangying. Except for Yue Dapeng, Huang Renlong, and Lin Qiushui, the main characters of Daijiayuan were present. Toast by the three landlords. The first table above the guests is the Golden Body Luohan Fa Yuan, Yao Kaijiang, Chen Changtai, Luo Jiu, Lu Xianming, and Guo Yunzheng, and the dumb channel of the Huashan School. The second table is the Huashan Paihuo Lion Cao Fei, Baihu Xingjun Yucai Valley, multi -armed bear Mao Tai, Perak hand captain Chi Yuan, Jiugai Xianhu Liu Yanniang, Xiao Fang Shuo Shen stealing Wu Xiao, three -eyed red neon Xue Python. Third, the four tables are Liu Yanniang&rsquo;s distant brothers pink peony through Yunyanfei Liu Xiongfei, Putanus Cui Tianzhang, and Qiankun, Wei Town, a flower Wang Yier. , Huahua Taoist Yao Suxiu, Pseudou Tuo Yao Yuan, the evil box gorge has been evil for many years Wei Qi, Water Snake Wei Eight, Batawa Dongli Town Chuan, mixed Yuan Shi Zhangyu, eight -handed arrow Yan Mengsheng, chasing Xiao Wu, Changjiang Shuihu Sima Shou. The thirteen people sat in two tables, all of which were rivers and thieves on the rivers and lakes. Bai and Dai Zhu have also seen one or two sides, and some are well -known.  There are about seven major rooms in the Guangquan Hall of Daijia. Due to the number of people from Lucun earlier, all the furnishings on the hall were removed from the hall, and eight tables were placed, divided into two lines, and the guests were opposed to each side. At this time, it was full of seven tables, and one table was still. Bai Qi was going to withdraw from him. Suddenly, he saw Yue Dapeng, Huang Renlong, and Lin Qiushui accompanied the two to walk in from the outside. Later, followed by the flower of the snake to capture the snake, and faced it up, and he was the main position. That Huazi also took a seat, even more polite, and did not let Yue, Huang and Lin people drink and drink from all the way. Fa Yuan had seen Huazi appeared, thinking that it was the assistant that Bai Qi invited, and it was not very strange. The rest of the people were allocated outside. At this time, he saw him followed Yue, Huang, and Lin to the Lord&rsquo;s seat. Of course, this swordsman did not look at people with his clothes, and between the enemy and me confrontation and folding the bottle, each person glanced at each other. Master Yuqing changed from the existence of the evil, and he had a wide range of knowledge. Shi Cai was in the Yao Kaijiang Fighting method in Yu Shendong. He couldn&rsquo;t hold it. I suddenly saw a purple Guanghua flashing slightly under the sun and broke the enemy&rsquo;s magic method together. Flying back, it was called Bai Qi for a while. I was afraid that it was too late. At a glance, the blossom was in front of everyone, using the method of moving the mountain to shrink the land, and sent everyone out of dangerous land. I was about to find him to answer. I thought: &ldquo;This person is like the stranger called Huazi. He has never listened to someone for many years, but he showed up here today. This person has always been willful. Today&rsquo;s victory and defeat are not known. &quot;</p>
<p>Because of the urgency of time, he only informed Yuan Yuanqi, and the two were still worried after entering. At this moment, when he saw him followed Yue, Huang, and Lin to the main seat, people who couldn&rsquo;t invite would come. With a glance with Wu Yuanqi, the two were silent. Knowing that this human temperament is special, if he entertains him at the bottom, it is not good, so he has to pretend to be ignored. He, Cui, Wu, and Thursday have only seen him in Yu Shendong. At this time, I saw him sitting in the seat. Although I felt that the guests came, I looked back at Master Yuan and Master Yuqing. It&rsquo;s not easy to ask the name. However, Bai Qi had been paying attention to him for a long time. First, he thought that he was a stranger who met Yue, Huang, and Lin. He was embarrassed to ask in front of the enemy. Later, I thought that I was a master. When I met for the first time, I never even asked the name. Is it rude? At the time of hesitation, someone said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a war, don&rsquo;t care about me. Don&rsquo;t worry about me. Don&rsquo;t eat you in vain, don&rsquo;t be distressed and afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound was as clear as a fly, very clear. Looking back at everyone, they are sitting well. When you look at the name of Huazi, he nodded facing him. At this moment, Heng Yu and Xu Chao returned to the seat on both sides of the master and guest.
Wu Yuanqi stood up and said to Fayuan: &ldquo;Today&rsquo;s things, the three leaders of Bai, Dai, and Xu, and Chen, and Ling are difficult to solve the results. The three of him were originally good intentions, I do n’t want to talk about their words, hurt the harmony, and then form a grudge between the two sides. First, it is approved today from Bai, Dai, and Xu to Chen Yanden to ask for guilty, and the owner of Baizhuang will go to the appointment every day. When I arrived at Lucun, I changed the guests and met here. Bai, Dai, and Xu were unwilling to fuck the same room because everyone was a native neighbor. The five subjects caused the fighting between the two villages and had many people and injured many people. Because they saw the owner of Chen Zhuang asking the Lord Luzhuang and the Taoist friends, they invited the poor to attend the event. Seeing the poverty -stricken way, he was a few years old. When you face up, be a person with two solutions with the two creations. Please still reconcile as early as possible, so as not to get deeper and deeper from each other&rsquo;s grievances. Tips, move Gan Ge? If Chen Zhuang is willing to abandon the suspect, and for the poverty, the poverty is willing to be guilty of his three. If he does not get his order, although the monarchs in the rivers and lakes are all the people of Gao Ming, but Everyone has learned differently, and the skills are also high and low. If you do n’t ask the academic depth of the stool, it will be flat. Now the owner of the Baizhuang has set up a high stage in the front square and has the main guest seat. Dai Liang Village is the main body, and after they are invited to scatter them, the two sides will teach on the stage to determine today. If the other parties invite, if you see the hobe, at that time, martial arts, or more than swordsmanship, or more than the Taoism, or more than the Taoism, or the Taoism, or the Taoism. Fa, each of them learned in his life, the skills are shallow, and the teaching is one by one, and the poverty is better to use this to open up. I wonder if you think of it? &quot;</p>
<p>Fa Yuan heard the words, got up and answered with a smile:&rdquo; In the past, when he was a daughter and two daughters, Chen Zhuang did not accept it. He argued with him, Luo Jiu, and Ling and Yu. Later, the owner of the Baizhuang vomited and said that he went to the third day of this month to ask for advice. This was a common thing about rivers and lakes. Lucun and Daijiachang were near neighbors. There were only fish Shendong separated. Send someone to spy several times? Then I took the Lord Luzhuang and others. Today, who is the matter who is wrong, is not a solution to the film. Fortunately . Poor monks and Taoist friends are generally not insiders. Lu and Chen have helped Taoist friends in Zhigui Village. They shocked the prestige of the Emei faction. Seeing the poor monks passing by here and inviting a temporary leader. The swordsmanship is high, but often with a large pressure and weakness. Although the defeat of the defeat, he knows that he is not as bad as he feels, and he will work hard again. It&rsquo;s not too early now. It is not beneficial. Mo Ru is better than martial arts according to the words of Taoist friends, the second more than the sword art, and then the Taoist method. There is no need to divide any master and guests. Everyone who comes with the poor monks is a guest. Guicun is the master. For a person who has been taught on stage, people who have no swordsmanship and Taoism have been counted. What do you think of Taoist friends? &quot;</p>
<p>佟 Yuan Yuan heard the words and replied with a smile:&rdquo; In this case, there is no need to say much. &quot;</p>
<p>After that, the chairman went on to&rdquo; please &quot;</p>
<p>, Fa Yuan and other phase rates also got up, divided into the square, and each of the guests ascended to the reed shed. Tong Yuanqi and Fa Yuan, the same thing, the same fear of not being able to suffer from swordsmanship. With the consent of both sides, they felt peace of mind. Not mentioned.</p>
