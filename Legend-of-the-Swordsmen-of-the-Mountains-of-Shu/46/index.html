    <p>Forty -five times Li Yingqiong walks lonely in Chichengzi in the middle of the way  It is said that when Master Guanghui saw the English man, he laughed and laughed: &ldquo;The child, how can there be a feast of life? You have such a good place, how can you not leave? Could you go with me to West Heaven? &quot;</p>
<p>Master Ying Nan&rsquo;s unknown master&rsquo;s intention is still struggling. The master laughed: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to leave me, or so, fortunately, there is still a month of gathering, then you will come and go on both sides for the time being, and then talk about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yingnan asked where to go after January? The master just smiled and urged her to sleep. On the second day, do what you should do first, Master Mingming, come to see Ying Qiong. Talking about the words of the master, Ying Qiong is because of his own difficulties. Although Ying Nan is not unable to fly, he is much stronger than herself. Since the master Xu she is here, he can no longer ask for it. Move now. British men were willing to agree, and only promised to learn swords together often. When they met the night or the weather was not good, they stayed here. Ying Qiong stayed for a while, but still had no effect, so she had to be by her. The English man taught the kung fu tuzzles passed by the master. Ying Qiong remembered in his heart and practiced in the morning and evening. I also asked Ying Men to see Master Guanghui. However, the master refused, but only called the British men&rsquo;s biography: I met the fate of the sun, learned to become swordsmanship, and left a little more good virtue. Since the day of the heroes from the man, it is New Year&rsquo;s Eve. The British man also went to Master Ming, and went to Yingqiong Cave Medium. Ying Qiong&rsquo;s Ying Nan often comes and goes, and is not lonely. Just suffering from ice and snow, you can&rsquo;t go everywhere.  On the fifth day of the fifth day, I suddenly heard the carving outside the cave and hurried out of the hole. When looking up, there was also a big carving in the sky, which was generally large and small, and was flying down. Take a closer look, this carving is also a gold -eye steel beak. It looks like Buddha slaves, but it is white, but the mouth of the same carving under the belly is black. The god sculpture and Buddha slaves greeted each other. When Ying Qiong saw the great joy, he asked the god sculpture: &ldquo;Brother Golden Eye, is this your good friend? I ask it to have some waxy flavor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, then ran into the cave and cut a plate of odors. Out. The white carving was not eaten, and nodded only towards Ying Qiong. After the god sculpture finished eating the large dish, he looked towards Ying Qiong, and flew up with the white carving. Ying Qiong didn&rsquo;t know whether the carving was given away, or was taken away by the white carving, so he was so anxious to call. The god sculpture heard Ying Qiong&rsquo;s voice, and flew down again. Seeing that the white carving was still hovering at a low altitude, she seemed to be with her peers, and she could not help but panic. A long neck of the god sculpture asked: &ldquo;Brother Golden Eye, I am accompanied by you, with a lot of loneliness and danger. Now if you are sending guests, you will return when you are young, then there is nothing; if you are one, you will be Don&rsquo;t go back, don&rsquo;t you hurt me? &quot;</p>
<p>The sculpture shook his head, tightened his body next to Ying Qiong, and showed his reluctant spirit. Ying Qiong said happily: &ldquo;Then you have gone to the guest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sculpture shook her head again. Ying Qiong said anxiously again: &ldquo;Then you are not going, not back, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carving looked up at the sky, and the two wings couldn&rsquo;t help fanning, as if they were going to fly. Ying Qiong suddenly moved and said, &ldquo;I want Master Bai Mei to come to call you with your companion. You still have to come back after you listen to the scriptures, are you? A few times, so as to avoid my suspense? &quot;</p>
<p>The sculpture heard the words, and it really called nineteen. Ying Qiong Momo&rsquo;s heart. The god carving screamed nineteen, and the white carving seemed to be very impatient in the air, and twice. The god sculpture lowered his head under the elbow of Ying Qiong, left Yingqiong&rsquo;s hand, and squeezed long. Ying Qiong looked at the two carved wings, and she couldn&rsquo;t help but feel strange. At first, she was suspected that the sculpture went back to the British man and accompanied her. After a while, I saw the two sculptures flying from the west of the liberation slopes, and rose into the cloud watch in a blink of an eye.  Ying Qiong is innocent, and he has been with the god sculpture for many days. He has a deep emotion. Although he is temporarily separated, he can&rsquo;t help but feel very uncomfortable. British men have something to do because they have something to do in the middle for a day and two days. One person is empty and unlimited. For a while, I returned to the cave and ate lunch randomly. Take out his father&rsquo;s long sword, go to the empty ground outside the cave, and practice according to the sword method passed by the English man. When I was able to practice hard, I suddenly heard a cold wind behind me. When I quickly looked back, I saw that there was a tourist priest behind him, yellow crowns, and mango&rsquo;s socks. Ying Qiong saw a mockery on his face, and his heart was unhappy. How to hear Li Ning said that this cliff stands thousands of stories and isolated from the outside world. If someone comes, he will not dare to care about it. At the moment, I asked the man and asked: &ldquo;The Taoist Chiefs laughed. Do you see me not well practiced?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man heard the words, showing a disdain on his face, and laughed at his face: &ldquo;Is it not good? I haven&rsquo;t gotten yet! &quot;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong saw the man&rsquo;s arrogance and couldn&rsquo;t help but think about it, thinking:&rdquo; My father and uncle Zhou, also the heroes of the year, for decades, have not encountered an enemy. The swordsmanship of the British men is also a master of Guanghui personally. Even if it is not good, how can she not even enter the door? This poor way, dare to be so rude! How can people who really have the ability? I am alone here, come here to bully me, and want to seize my cave. Today, the god sculpture is not here. He is really a swordsman and fairy, and when he responded to the words of the ancestor of Bai Mei, I worshiped him as a teacher; if I wanted to occupy my cave, if I couldn&rsquo;t beat it, I fled to the male sister and temporarily lived temporarily. , Wait for the god carving back, and then calculate the account with him. &quot;</p>
<p>She was thinking in her heart, and the man seemed to see her intention. Said: &ldquo;Little girl, are you not convinced? How difficult is this. You are young, I really play with you, even if you win you, you will be laughing at each other. I will be cheap with you now. : I stand here, although you stabbed me with your sword. If you can stick to me a little flesh, you can count on my studies and scratch your head. In one breath, you will blow you out of the three feet, then you confess to lose, and I will bring you to a place to find you a female sword immortal master. Are you willing? &quot;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong heard that he heard that, Zheng Qiong heard that he heard that he heard that satisfied. Listening to this human tone, knowing that the words of Bai Mei&rsquo;s ancestor said can be fulfilled. The doubtful family must take her cave thoughts and fully release it. However, the person is suspicious of that person saying a big words, and you can try it to try it. After thinking about the idea, I replied: &ldquo;Since the Taoist chief is instructed, forgive the disciples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that, he pinched the sword tactics in his right hand and pointed towards the Taoist. A Dapeng&rsquo;s winged posture, with a sloppy stroke, his left hand sword tips, and his right hand with the sword with his right hand, piercing the Taoist&rsquo;s chest. This was originally a virtual trick. If the enemy wants to avoid it, he must be fooled; if he does not avoid, she will come over. When Ying Qiong saw that there was nothing wrong with doing things, he would not avoid. I thought: &ldquo;This Taoist does not hide from my sword, he must rely on his kung fu on the golden bell cover. He does not know that my father&rsquo;s sword blows the hair. Why hurt his life? Mo Ru, just click him, just tell him to confess his guilt and lose. &quot;</p>
<p>Saying was late, at that time, Ying Qiong thought about it here, and he defined the tip of the sword slightly and scratched the man&rsquo;s left shoulder. There was about an inch of the sword next to the sword. Ying Qiong suddenly felt that the sword tip seemed to be blocked by something. The resistance of this block was just soft and very powerful. Fortunately, he only used three -point force, otherwise he would be hit by the enemy. Ying Qiong was shocked and knew that he had met the enemy. With a little foot, a swallow was wearing the clouds, raised his two feet, and a yellow cricket was empty, and he turned down and stabbed his shoulders. Like the last time, the sword hit the person and hit it back. He said that he hurt people&rsquo;s flesh and couldn&rsquo;t even have clothes. Ying Qiong has to prevent others from returning, and every move is not a hit, and she quickly goes out. It seemed to have stabbed twenty or thirty swords like this, and none of them hurt the Taoist.
Ying Qiong was ashamed and anxious, I don&rsquo;t know what to do.</p>
<p>Later, every time I saw it, the Taoist always looked at himself with his eyes.</p>
<p>As soon as Ying Qiong stabbed him, he turned around again, but he didn&rsquo;t return his hands.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong suddenly realized, thinking: &ldquo;This person is not an evil law, it must be a special qigong. Seeing where he stabs with a sword, he will transport where he is lucky, so he can&rsquo;t stab him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He frowned. Dengshi came up with an urgent trick: deliberately used very powerful, adopted Mustang to divide the mane, hidden the posture of Shenlong&rsquo;s claws, stabbing the Taoist chest. Only before the Taoist, he was busy with the light, busy retracted the influence, slammed his feet, raised his two feet high, and came to a fish eagle in the water. Looking at it, it seemed to fall in front of the Taoist, and he pierced it with a sword again. The man watched how Ying Qiong was stabbed intently. Who knew that Ying Qiong was about three or four feet above the person&rsquo;s head, and stood his right foot on his left foot. Another swallow copied the water and pushed together to raise the height. The tricks, using the strength to make the momentum, the body bias, a wind blows the flowers, and the illness is like an eagle. One kick, his head facing down, his feet facing up, and dancing the sword in his hand, making 50 % of the strength, a weaver girl shuttle, piercing the Taoist back. I thought it would be successful this time. Suddenly, when I saw a white light, I listened to it, and my sword seemed to hit on it, and it was startled. I had to have another ape monkey under the tree. When you look closely at the sword in your hand, you like it and have no damage. When I couldn&rsquo;t think of the good law to deal with the person, the man had come over and said, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of you at a young age, there will be such an urgent wisdom, but I can see that I use the mixed vitality kung fu. Calculate me. If I had to protect you with sword qi, you would almost hit your tricks. Now your various tricks have finished, what else do you say? &quot;</p>
<p>At this time, Ying Qiong knows People will have swordsmanship. They must be psychologically psychologically and meet this kind of person. I don&rsquo;t know what today, when I saw this person, I always hate it. Knowing that you need to deal with your ability, it will definitely not work. Dark hating the god sculpture and the Buddha did not leave early, and did not leave late, but I was going today, which hurt me to meet this rogue old way, there was no way. When I was anxious, I couldn&rsquo;t help crying. The man said again: &ldquo;Do you dare not be convinced? What I can say, you can blow you out of you in one breath, you have to test, do you want to see your master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong At this time, the more I felt that the man was annoying, and gradually scared in his heart. Where did he dare to experiment, he wanted to keep me in the past. After thinking about it, I said, &ldquo;The disciples are willing to confess their guilty and lose. The disciples are self -study, and they want to worship a sword fairy as a master. Teach him the sadness of the old man? Second, I have a companion and never come back. Furthermore, the famous name of the Taoist surname, the master of the master who worshiped me, and where the Xianxiang is, I do n’t know. Looking for me? I intend to invite Taoist and widening for a month. When my family comes back, I will go back. Or wait for my companion to come back and tell her where I am going, so that she will tell her father to rest assured. how?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the man heard the words, haha ​​laughed: &ldquo;Little girl, you have to speak with me. Your father meets you with you at least two or three decades. Do you want to wait for that flat -haired beast to come back to protect your driving? It has not been a little bit, but after listening to the Bai Mei monk for a few years, is it still my opponent? If you think it is a good thing to follow you, it is a good thing, but how can I wait for it to wait for it ? You have to misunderstand what I have, and you do n’t know my origin. Now, tell you, my Taoist name is Akihiko, one of Kunlun nine friends. I am the least willing to accept apprentices in my life. This time I am my sister. The phenomenon of the phenomenon, come to her under her door. This is a good opportunity for a thousand years, and I will miss the different time. I&rsquo;m afraid that the carved one you feed will not see you, so you don’t know that the flat -haired animal will be born. The destiny of the white eyebrow monk will always be your guard. It can fly tens of thousands of miles a day. It is deeply pink. As long as you leave the address, it will find you in the season. ? I am supported by people, loyalty. You are willing to go better, you have to go. Anyway, after you have to see my sister, if you are still unwilling, I can still send you back. Now I want to want If you don&rsquo;t follow me, it&rsquo;s not. &quot;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong gradually believed that when he saw him say his origin. Knowing that he would not resist with him, he must not resist. Although he was annoying, maybe the female sword fairy he said was a good person and it was unknown. Mo Ru met the female sword fairy with him, and then made a reason. Anyway, he had promised himself that if he was unwilling to worship, he was still willing to send himself back. After the idea was determined, I said, &ldquo;Since the Taoist chief must be going to see the female sword fairy, I can&rsquo;t. Just what kind of origin is that female sword fairy, and where I live, I must explain to me first, so that let me let me so that let me let me so that Brother Jinyan came back to find me. I have a righteous sister who lives in this mountainside. You have to lead me to her first and tell her a few words. Knowing. Furthermore, I am like the female sword fairy. If I do n’t call my heart, you need to send me back. Otherwise, I would not go to death. &quot;</p>
<p>Chichengzi said:&rdquo; These things you have only cause Guanghui is wrong with me. When you get out of this one, you ca n’t depend on you, the rest can be rely on. Yunnan Border Xiuyue Ridge Zaohua Cliff. You can quickly let go of the letter. &quot;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong asked:&rdquo; That female sword fairy phenomenon, maybe she teach me to practice flying swords in the air? &quot;</p>
<p>Chichengzi said:&rdquo; Why not? &quot;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong said:&rdquo; I remembered, you are his brother, and of course you will fly the sword. You can take it out first to see what to see. If it is good, you don’t need to force me to go. I worshiped it. &quot;</p>
<p>Chichengzi said,&rdquo; What&rsquo;s wrong with this? &quot;</p>
<p>After that, he raised his hand, and there was a white light flying, air -conditioned, and cold. At the end, the hands finger, and the white light flew towards an old tree beside the cliff, only one around, cut off out of thin air, and it would come down. A broken branch flew next to the Song Mei, and he fell into countless plum blossoms. When the flower rain passed, Bai Guang disappeared, and Akashiko was still fine, standing there. Joy Yingqiong dismissed the idea of ​​hate. Running into the cave with a high rush, he wrote a letter with Li Ning and Yingnan, and asked the British man to tell the god sculpting Buddha slave, and went to Xiuyueling Zaohua Cliff in Yunnan to find himself. After writing, I took some clothes out of the hole, and the Akashiko was impatient.  Ying Qiong was convinced that the words of Bai Mei ’s ancestor had been verified, and now he changed his name and shouted Akihito as his uncle. The cave door was sealed with stones and asked how many days it took to go to Yunnan. Chichengzi said: &ldquo;How many days do you use? You close your two eyes, you have to be afraid, we will leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, I put Yingqiong in the threat in one hand and shouted, &ldquo;Start!&rdquo;</p>
<p>go. When Yingqiong saw such a big skill, Yingqiong became more and more convinced. When she had a boldness, when she secretly opened her eyes and looked down, she saw that Baiyun wrapped around. A mountain of Emei was hundreds of miles. Without a few hours, I did not know that they had flying for thousands of miles, crossing countless mountains and rivers, gradually dusk, and had not yet reached the destination. The stars in heaven are particularly bright in the comparison of the world. Since the birth, such wonders have been seen since the birth.  I was happy in my heart, suddenly seeing the clouds on the opposite side, flying over dozens of different colors of glory. Akashiko shouted, &ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurriedly pressed the sword light and dropped at a mountain. Ying Qiong looked at the four sides of the mountain. I saw the mountains and rims, and the rock valley was strange. The mountains were full of plum trees. On the corner of the cliff, a temple faintly appeared. Akashiko looked at it, and hurriedly took Yingqiong to turn around the cliff, and walked straight to the temple. Ying Qiong saw that the temple was not very large, and the temple wall industry collapsed eastward. There was only one fell to the ground with the two temple doors, which was eroded by the wind and rain, and the paint on the door had fallen off. There is a clock tower in the courtyard, and there are only two windows left. On the big wooden frame under the floor, there was a drum hanging, but the red paint outside was bright and eye -catching. Seeing a few coffins in the hall. In this temple, I want to abbot for many years, so it has fallen into such a decline. Chichengzi was walking forward, and was about to raise his foot to enter the temple. He saw the drum in the temple, &ldquo;咦&rdquo;</p>
<p>, busy and retracting back, reaching out and holding Ying Qiong, flying into the clock tower. Ying Qiong was about to ask him to bring himself here. Chichengzi stopped quickly. He whispered: &ldquo;At this moment, it is not when I speak, and I can meet me in the cloud road. I have to come to find me when I was young. He Shouwu, you eat when you are hungry, you can not be hungry for three or five days. Within three days, you must not leave this place. If you still do n’t see me back, you plan to go. When you play outside the temple, remember that you ca n’t. Through the downstairs court, you are within the same hall. You just need to stand on the window, go to the temple wall, and then go down from the temple wall. When I met any danger, I couldn&rsquo;t help it to rescue, and I couldn&rsquo;t act arbitrarily. Keep it tightly! &quot;</p>
<p>After that, let go of the two branches of He Shouwu, I don&rsquo;t answer Yingqiong to answer, a white light, and go in the air.
Ying Qiong is bold and bold.</p>
<p>Seeing Akashiko&rsquo;s action, she is really a flying sword fairy, who is already dazzling.</p>
<p>When he wanted to ask him who was the opponent and why he was put in this ancient temple, Akashito had gone around.</p>
<p>He had no choice but to wait for him to come back in the clock tower as he said.</p>
<p>After sending the white light at the moment, I looked back at the inside of the bell tower.</p>
<p>I saw the spider was in the household and the four walls was sealed.</p>
<p>The Buddha&rsquo;s altar provided was also broken.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong came to the ancient temples of the deep mountains thousands of miles away with a weak woman.</p>
<p>Several thoughts of going out of the temple to see the mountain scenery, because they were shocked by the words of Chichengzi, they did not dare to act.</p>
<p>Gradually at dusk, Akihiko had not seen a turn, and felt hungry in his belly, so he took the skill of He Shouwu to eat.</p>
<p>The mouth is sweet and sweet, and it is very delicious.</p>
<p>After eating half a branch, I didn&rsquo;t feel hungry in my belly.</p>
<p>Yingqiong is afraid that Chichengzi will have to return for three or two days.</p>
<p>She dare not finish eating at will, so she still hides the remaining half of Shouwu in her arms.</p>
<p>After sweeping the dust on the front futon, sit on it and rest.</p>
<p>Sorrow for a while, annoyed for a while, and ran to the window to overlook the color.</p>
<p>At this time, the weather gradually became darker.</p>
<p>A round of bright moon was rising from the foot of Dongshan.</p>
<p>Blow, I couldn&rsquo;t help crying.</p>
<p>After playing for a while, I felt reluctant, and forgot all my concerns.</p>
<p>After all, Yingqiong is the child&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>I always think of going outside the temple.</p>
<p>I have a full moon color and plum blossoms.</p>
<p>She forgot about the words of Chichengzi for a long time.</p>
<p>This bell tower is three or four feet away from the ground, and the ladder has collapsed and cannot go down.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong has practiced light body skills in Emei.</p>
<p>She was instructed by her father&rsquo;s instructions.</p>
<p>She had already practiced as light as a swallow.</p>
<p>Stand up now, as soon as you board your feet, you have passed from the window to the temple wall, and the wall is passed from the wall to the outside of the temple.</p>
<p>Seeing the bright moon plum blossoms outside the temple, it really wins the scenery and is very interesting.</p>
<p>At this time, the moon was thousands of miles, and it was as clear as day.</p>
<p>Only a dozen stars flashed, the moonlight was bright, and it looked bright.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong came to the Plum Forest and put through it and worn out, so unhappy.</p>
<p>After wandering for a while, Akashiko was still a sound without a message, and he didn&rsquo;t know what the opponent he met.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, I gradually felt a little cold.</p>
<p>I planned to go back to the bell tower, opened the small parcel brought by myself, put a piece of clothes to put on, and then compared.</p>
<p>While thinking about it, he walked into the temple.</p>
<p>At present, the beauty has long forgotten the danger of the situation.</p>
<p>Only when I walked in front of the bell tower, I saw the big drums on the shelf, and it seemed like a word on the drum.</p>
<p>I thought: &ldquo;This broken temple is full of dust everywhere. This big drum alone is like a new drum, and there is no stars on it. There is no stars on it. It was big and heavy, so I wanted to take it to see it. He heard the two buns in the hall. Ying Qiong was deeper at the night. In the ancient temple of the barren mountains, when he heard this strange voice, he couldn&rsquo;t help the hair upright. When I first entered the temple for the first time, I saw a few coffins stopped in the temple; when Akashi was going, it was not good. When I came, I hurried, and I only brought the silver of the clothes with myself, and never brought the blade. The more I thought about it, the more I felt scared. When I couldn&rsquo;t help but stealing my eyes to the hall, there were four coffins in the moonlight shadow, and one of the coffin covered one side. When Ying Qiong saw nothing, he felt relieved, and had no intention to play the hammer. When he was about to return to the bell tower, Shi Cai&rsquo;s strange sound rose again, and twice, there was a black Dongxi flying out. Ying Qiong shouted, &quot;</p>
<p>Not good!&rdquo; Regardless of the three seven twenty -one, she went to the wall with only one vertical. When looking down, it was a big bat that originally flew out, which scared himself. I couldn&rsquo;t help but &quot;</p>
<p>embarrass&rdquo;, and my heart was settled. Then there was another strange smell blowing with the wind, and a slight breathing sound was smelled next to his ears. At this time, Yingqiong was already the sound of the wind, and the grass and trees were all soldiers. Open my two eyes, watch around, without moving, knowing that I am timid. It is about to go from the wall to the clock tower. The sound of breathing of the right thing is behind the head, the closer to it. Looking back at it, it was scared. It turned out that she was standing behind a skeleton standing behind her, her eyes were red, her body was green, and her bones were bone. And stretched out two bird -like long hands to make a posture behind her. At the gap between the temple wall, there were only seven or eight feet highs, and the monsters of the monster. Yingqiong was originally made a posture to go upstairs. In this crisis, she was not in trouble. Ying Qiong was frightened by the monster, and his feet fell empty. Fortunately, the body was out of the way, and she was in a hurry and was anxious. While the two feet were not yet on the ground, the left foot was put on the right foot on the right foot. , Taking advantage of the energy, only one vertical, the dragonflies to the bell tower early. As soon as I stood firmly, I heard the sound of the coffin in the lower hall rolling. After a while, there was a big loud noise, obviously the sound of the coffin covered. Then there were three loud noises. Looking at the green and red -eyed monster just now, I had walked around the front door, entered the courtyard, and walked straight to the bell tower. After a while, three of the same monsters popped out of the hall, all of which were green and red eyes, white bones, one by one stretched out bird&rsquo;s claws, jumping towards Ying Qiong, and he was willing to be willing. Although Ying Qiong was bold, he couldn&rsquo;t help scaring a cold sweat. Fortunately, the bell tower is very high. Although the four monsters are fierce, their bodies are not stool, their legs are straight, and they cannot bend. Although they jump upwards, there is still a bunny tower, so they will fall down. When Ying Qiong saw that monster couldn&rsquo;t go up, he relaxed slightly.  After the horror was set, I wanted to find some things to prevent my body in case. Looking around in the bell tower, I suddenly saw the Buddha&rsquo;s belly in the shrine, breaking a cave, and the green light was faintly emitted in the inside, which was surprised. Stretching into the Buddha&rsquo;s belly, I touched the Buddha&rsquo;s belly, and took out a thing like a horn, and there was a symbol. It was not gold and non -stone. Ying Qiong couldn&rsquo;t find anything to prevent it, so he took it in his hand. When looking backstairs, the four monsters actually jumped higher and higher, and it was only three or four feet to jump to the window several times. This few feet are always impossible. Eight steel -like bird claws caught the wooden boards on the bell tower. The four monsters seemed to jump for a while. Seeing that the purpose was difficult to get, the head of the head was very furious. Suddenly, they ran down under the bell tower to push the few wooden pillars. Let the people upstairs fall down and chew again. The remaining three monsters are like this, and they also move forward to help together. The bell tower has been in disrepair for a long time, and it has long been decaying. The four monsters are all infinitely powerful. They can withstand how they pushed them and pushed the wooden pillars of the bell tower to the east and fell over the west. That little bell tower, like a boat with a large wind and waves, could not shake it under the eight bird&rsquo;s claws, and the doors and windows upstairs, together with the bricks on the top, fell down. In the critical moment, Ying Qiong stood on the window sill, preparing the bell tower to fall, and flew up the wall to escape. The idea had to be determined. Suddenly, the big pillar of a building would come down. Yingqiong knew that the building was going to collapse, and she didn&rsquo;t even neglect her. As soon as she boarded her feet, she went to the wall of the temple. Knowing that the monster could not jump, when I saw that the roof of the main hall also had three feet high, I went up from the wall. Quietly lying on the ridge of the temple, while peeking down with eyes, he heard the sound of rush. Then there was a loud noise, and a clock tower was pushed down by the monster. There was another sound, and a roof beam was inserted directly on the red drum, drumming the big hole of the shiny people. The four monsters were at the beginning of pushing the building, and they were doing the destruction work. They never paid attention to Ying Qiong to escape. As soon as I pushed the building, I went to the rubble pile to find people to be used. At the beginning of the eight steel claws, the rubble under the moonlight fluttered. The monster turned over for a while, and couldn&rsquo;t find Ying Qiong, so he went to get angry with the drum, even torn the band, and broke the drum to shatter the side early. At the same time, he screamed madly, as if looking for it on all sides. Suddenly, when she saw Ying Qiong under the moonlight, she looked up and found that Ying Qiong hid. The four monsters squeaked each other, surrounded the halls on all sides, scrambling to grab the spine. There was a monster standing in front of the pile of drums. He was about to be anxious, kicking his feet, and was stumbled by the drum. It turned out that these four monsters were made of zombies in the long age. Although they walked like flying, they were not flexible due to their bones. Except for both hands, the rest were not very flexible. Falling on the ground, it is not easy to get up. The remaining three monsters have grasped the tile ridge in front of the temple, and they must go up the vertical hall. Ying Qiong couldn&rsquo;t think of resistance, so he unveiled the tile at the top of the temple, and hit the two monsters that climbed up first.</p>
