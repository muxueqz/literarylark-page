    <p>43rd Back to Daxuekong Mountain cutting stock therapy, walking, small filial piety, Xiao Jianyu Biya Danjian worshiping true immortals  Ying Qiong was sad for a while, and almost burst into tears.</p>
<p>I reluctantly held back my sorrow and stuffed Li Ning.</p>
<p>All the bedding on his bed with cotton coats and other categories is covered on Li Ning, hoping to sweat some sweat.</p>
<p>At this time, it was night, and the snow was returned by snow and light, but the cave was dark.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong thought that she had not eaten yet, and she was sad and could not swallow.</p>
<p>I was afraid that I was ill, and the patient had no one care, so I had to barely drink two cold porridge.</p>
<p>I also thought of the experience of talent, moved the porridge pot to the brazier, and then cook some boiling water and the same rice.</p>
<p>After packing, he sat next to the stone couch flame, tears and Wang Wang looked at the father on the bed, and then touched his head to sweat on his head.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, suddenly the wind was pulled out of the cave, like a wave of roar, rolling.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong kept this decaying dish, and was bold.</p>
<p>The original stone cave they lived in the original is divided into two floors.</p>
<p>The outer layers were built with stones, which was very solid.</p>
<p>There was only a large stone at the exit that it could be opened and closed to the portal.</p>
<p>In order to install the windshield used in winter and make it with coarse cloth and cotton.</p>
<p>It is about three or four inches thick and very strict.</p>
<p>Otherwise, how can you stand above this snowy mountain.</p>
<p>Ying Qiongyi did not solve it, and never closed his eyes all night.</p>
<p>Until the next day, Li Ningzhou was sweating and woke up.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong asked, &ldquo;Daddy, the disease has healed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Ning said: &ldquo;People have gradually got better, and they are useless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong took the porridge rice and Li Ning used it a little bit. Ying Qiong didn&rsquo;t know that the patient couldn&rsquo;t eat more, and secretly anxious. At this time, Li Ning Shenzhi gradually cleared, knowing that Ying Qiong had not slept overnight, his eyes were red and swollen like a peach, so he was so sorry. It is said that this cold is not a serious illness. The patient should not eat more. Moreover, after sweating, the person has become better. After urging Yingqiong to eat, he sleeps. Ying Qiong would still be suspicious, and only Gu Zhi would not go. Later, Li Ning pretended to be angry, and even persuaded her to coax. Ying Qiong was afraid that her father was worried about tiredness and reluctantly. She was willing to sleep under Li Ning&rsquo;s feet in order to take care of it. Li Ning saw her filial piety and had to be by her. How can Yingqiong sleep well, just like Li Ning calling her. When you hurriedly asked, it was not. Seeing the filial piety of loved daughter, Li Ning secretly was sad, and he couldn&rsquo;t be as good as herself. Who thought of the cold and heat in the evening to malaria. It ’s so good that it’ s time to be better. Several times to go down the mountain to extend the medicine, Li Ning insisted that he was not allowed, and no one took care of it. Ying Qiong is difficult to advance and retreat, and her heart is like a knife.  On the sixth day, the sky was clear. Ying Qiong thought of the method of acting the ancients to cut stocks. While Li Ning was unconscious, he took Li Ning&rsquo;s knife and walked outside the hole. Then stood up and heard a sculpture. When I looked up, I saw a large sculpture standing on the left cliff, a red -eye red beak, two steel claws, pure black, and no mixed hair. Looking at Ying Qiong screaming twice, she couldn&rsquo;t help picking up her hair, and looking forward to her posture. If in the past, Ying Qiong had already released the hidden weapon, wouldn&rsquo;t it be easy to spare it. At this time, because his father was in danger, he had no such time. He only glanced at the sculpture, and he still started according to the scheduled policy. First roll the red sleeves of the left hand, showing the Hao wrist with Xuehui. Take the knife in the right hand to remove the lag in the mouth of the Sakura mouth, and is about to cut it on the left arm. Suddenly, the wind was born, and the shadow in front of him was shaking, a sparse god, and the sword in his hand was caught by the golden eye carved with his claws. Ying Qiong cursed: &ldquo;The evil animals who do not know the death of the dead actually dare to move the soil on Tai Sui&rsquo;s head!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After scolding, he ran back to the hole and took out a few hidden weapons with the same long sword. At the beginning of the carving, the knife was caught in the paw, and only one threw, and it fell under the deep pond. Still flying to the corner of the cliff of Shi Cai, and continued to clean the hair, it seemed that he did not put the enemy on his heart. Ying Qiong is afraid that the carving fleets, and it is not easy to start, chasing it gently. That carving had already seen Ying Qiong who secretly chased the blade, not only did not escape, but she opened her two straight eyes, leaning her head, looking at Ying Qiong, and there was a big contempt. Involved Ying Qiong, a step, even if she was from the sculpture Xu Yuan, her left hand was connected to the crossbow, her right hand gold dart, and at the same time, she would get out of the carved body. The hidden weapons in Yingqiong were handy and practiced everyday. No matter how dexterous birds and beasts, she met her from no luck. Who wants to see the Yingjiong hidden weapon coming, not flying, raise his left paw, and grab the golden dart in the claw as soon as you catch it. The play was generally tilted with his head, slightly flying, and the Yingqiong Sanzhi crossbow was sideways in his mouth. He screamed twice towards Ying Qiong, as if very proud. The cliff horn was not as high as Zhang Xu, and it stretched out beside the cliff. The right of the cliff is Wanzhangshen Lake, and the bottom is invisible. Yingqiong&rsquo;s unpove unplugged, very tired and sad, nervous, was stimulated, and panicked. This cliff -horn was the practice of being light in the past. At this time, because the carving deliberately found her trouble, it caused sexuality. She was determined to take the life of the carving. In the moment, the Liuhe sword that had been studying in the crow&rsquo;s mouth was wearing the clouds and Yueyue&rsquo;s body. A step was a step, and even the sword flew to the corner of the cliff, and a sword pierced the carved neck. Seeing Ying Qiong flew towards it, he opened his wings, and together, Ying Qiong stabbed an empty, and he was stubborn. He was not stood still. He was opened by the carved wheels and flew to Ying Qiong. Top of the head. When Ying Qiong saw that the carving was too fierce, he knew it was not good, and he hurried to the sword. When he was waiting for the sculpture, he was too late. He was scanned by the carved on the left wing, swept towards Ying Qiong&rsquo;s back, and hit it. Although the sculpture did not make much effort, it was enough to fan the people. Ying Qiong was unstable, fell from the corner of the cliff towards Wanzhang Deep Lake, and his body fluttered down lightly. I saw the shadow of snow in the mountain walls on both sides of the white, dazzling. Knowing that you go, it is a broken bone, and his life is difficult to protect. Thinking of the sick father in Shidong, his heart is like a knife cut. I was sad and scared, and faintly pain on the back of the fierce feelings, as if being caught by something, the speed was reduced, and it was not like the stones just flew down and fell down. In a hurry, it was the golden eye carving. I do n’t know when to fly down and grabbing my waist ribbon. Because Li Ning said in the past, all the birds captured the creatures, after catching the claws, flying to the high altitude, throwing it on the rocks, and then pecking down, guess it was not good at the carving. One has just fallen into the deep pool of sword industry; the other is half -suspended in the air, which makes it impossible. I was afraid that the carving was pecking with my mouth in the air, so I had to listen to it for the time being, and simply waited for it to bring itself out of the deep pool, reaches the ground, and then compare it. Touching it with your hands, and the two darts left were not lost, and he could not help but live. Then he took out quietly, took it in his hand, and prepared to get out of the deep pool, and then gave the carved dart nearby to get rid of danger. Who thinks that the carving does not fly up, and a straightforward drops, the two wings are darling, and the two wings are smooth, and they slowly fall towards the pond.  Ying Qiong didn&rsquo;t know that the carved had taken her to the bottom of the Tan, and was so anxious. The emotion is dangerous, and when things come, you will not think of survival. Ying Qiong has a big boldness, not only putting the degree of life and death, and rearing this to look at the wonderful scenery of Yantan. After the decrease of tens of feet, the snow was no longer available, and gradually felt warm. I saw a group of white clouds flying from their feet to their heads. Sometimes when you go into the cloud array, you are surrounded by the clouds, and you can&rsquo;t see anything. Sometimes Baiyun, who was like a dumplings, flew into the sleeve and resumed again. When looking down, the sight was blocked by the white clouds, and it was almost invisible. The cloud layer passed through layers of layers, and suddenly saw a large cliff below the cliff beside the feet. The strange stone on it was like a sword and a sharp scales. Isn&rsquo;t it like a pink? Ying Qiong closed his eyes and was chilling, and he was about to shout &ldquo;My life is resting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carving suddenly increased, a turn, holding the wings, and drilling from a six -footed hole next to the cliff. Ying Qiong thought that he would die, but he hadn&rsquo;t seen movement for a long time, and he was still caught by the carving. When I couldn&rsquo;t help but open my eyes, I saw that there were only more than ten feet away from the ground below, and the sound of the bell fish was faintly smelled. I thought: &ldquo;In this thousands of bangs, how can there be a monk to live here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was surprised. At this time, the speed of the carving is getting more and more decreased. When Ying Qiong looked at the four outside, I saw that the stone walls were green and green, red and purple, full of strange flowers, fragrance and depression, and straight nose. The area is also gradually broad, it is simply a unique sky. It is completely late -spring. Where is the cold wind in winter? Can&rsquo;t help but get happy. The body only turned to the side, thinking that I was still under the iron claws, and it was good or bad; even if I could get rid of the danger, I didn&rsquo;t know thousands of feet away from it. How can I go up? Moreover, the father is still sick and no one is serving, and I don&rsquo;t know how to suspect himself. I can&rsquo;t help but come from it. The closer the carved flying was, the next to the mountain Abizen below, there was a few ancient trees with a tall height. The voice of the bell suddenly stopped, and a little Sami walked out of the tree and called out: &ldquo;Do Buddha slaves invite the guests?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air hovering in the air, refused to go. Ying Qiong was getting close to the ground, and took out the golden darts early to prepare for the camera. Seeing that the carving could not live in high altitude, this is naturally returning to Xiang. It is no better to land flat and steadily through its two wings. In the end, people are the body of flesh and blood, and you are unique in Ying Qiong. He was caught by the sculpture. Several turns were dizzy and turned around. The little Sami shouted loudly below, and she never heard it. The carving circled for a while, a long howling, holding the wings, and the crossbow split down the ground. At about three or four feet away from the ground, let the iron claws loose, put down Yingqiong, and rose again.
At this time, Ying Qiong&rsquo;s consciousness was fainted and fainted on the ground.</p>
<p>Stop for a while, hearing the voice of someone talking next to the ears.</p>
<p>When I opened the beautiful eyes, I saw a small Sami stand in front of me, about the same age as myself.</p>
<p>Listening to his mouth: &ldquo;The Buddha slaves are rude, Tan Yue was shocked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong barely supported, stood up and asked, &ldquo;I was on the top of the mountain, and I was caught here by a large sculpture. What is here? How did you get rid of the danger? How can a little master know? &quot;</p>
<p>The little sand met with a grin:&rdquo; The female Tan Yue is here, but the former cause. When I was young, I would be punished for it. The family teacher is now waiting for Yunchao.  At this time, Yingqiongye had seen this clearly, and was the fairy cave house, the cave is blessed. I saw that there were spiritual peaks and mountains on all sides. There is a large nan tree next to the Abesen in front of the mountain, which is only a few feet high, but the tree body is rough and five or six feet. The vine is wiped, and many unknown Qihua grows on it. Among the green moss marks, the two abbot characters &quot;</p>
<p>Ningbi&quot; faintly appeared. Although Ying Qiong was unreasonable, he knew that he was less dangerous here, so he followed the small Sami to the tree. Seeing that the tree industry was hollow, a shed in the top of the tree. I thought: &quot;</p>
<p>This person lives on the top of this big tree and is good at playing.&quot; The closer to the cliff to the cliff, the more &quot;</p>
<p>Ningbi&quot; two cliffs are more clearly seen. Suddenly remembered the note left by the white eyebrow monk, I couldn&rsquo;t help but blurted, &quot;</p>
<p>Is there no place here?&quot; The little Sami replied with a smile: &quot;</p>
<p>This is the Ningbi Cliff. Sending the Buddha slave, I didn&rsquo;t want to invite the female Tan Yue. Please see the family teacher. &ldquo;Ying Qiong heard the words, and was sad and happy: the heaven is not upset, and Ning Biya actually whereabouts were where they had a whereabouts. The sadness is that the father was infected in bed, and he didn&rsquo;t know his whereabouts, fearing that he was worried about adding illness. To this day, I had to meet the monk and make a comprehensive. While thinking, when I was walking into the tree heart, I heard a Buddha name, and it was very familiar. Then in front of him, there was one person in the industry. When he was careful, it was the white eyebrow monk encountered in Emei County. Ying Qiongfu came to the soul, hurriedly kneeling to the ground, his eyes with tears, saying: &quot;</p>
<p>Difficulty Ying Qiong, his father is in critical condition, and now he is far away from thousands of busts. He cannot go up to serve his father. Go up together, to rescue the disciples&rsquo; father. &ldquo;When he said, he cried and sorrowful. The monk replied: &quot;</p>
<p>The man in your father&rsquo;s Buddhist gate has a relationship with the old monk and wants to spend him into the empty door before leaving the address of Ningbi. Seeing his confidence or not. Later, he saw him converted. , I just ordered the slave to take it to the lead. It has been listening to the scriptures for many years, and the industry has been deeply psychic. Seeing that you cut the stock due to your father&rsquo;s illness, you are filial piety, and you specialize in you. The hidden weapon hurts it, it is wild and unwavering, and wants to make a joke with you. Its two -wing wind power is more than a thousand pounds. If you are not careful, you can bring you into the deep pool, and it will bring you here to meet the old monk here. It is suitable for the old monk. Report, I know everything. Your father&rsquo;s illness was originally cold and cold, and it didn&rsquo;t matter. There are elixir here. If you take some to take it with your father, you can cure. After the lead, I will go into the positive fruit. &ldquo;Ying Qiong heard that the carving was originally raised by the old Zen master. From this point of view, the illness of the father must not be hindered. He called back with medicine, and there must be a way to rise. Sure enough, his father was not bad. The old Zen master was a first -class Buddha. Can&rsquo;t help but evoke my mind, the hoe has finished, and begging again and. &quot;</p>
<p>The disciples and their father were dependent on each other. One person, lonely and young, how much is it? What do you have? I hope that the ancestor is compassionate, so that the disciples can also return to the fruit. &ldquo;The monk laughed:&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is it easy to talk about what you say. People; Besides, I never accept female disciples here. You have a thick endowment and have your own opportunity. I have a slang language in the future. . &ldquo;Ying Qiong saw the monk strictly refused, and remembered that the sick father in the cave did not dare to ask, so he had to follow. I also asked the ancestor&rsquo;s name, and the monk Bai Mei replied: &quot;</p>
<p>The old monk is named Bai Mei Monk. This Ningbi Cliff is one of the seventy -two caves. At four o&rsquo;clock, it is very quiet. Go back, far away from the deep lake of the deep lake, and you have to use Buddha slave to carry you up. It has been with me for many years, and there is a Taoist. You should be afraid. &quot;  The little Sha Mi heard the words, and suddenly he whispered, and his voice was clear, like the phoenix. After a while, I saw a black spot in Bi Xiao, and gradually appeared in the whole body, flying down the ground, it was the golden eye carving. There was a dart dart and three crossbow arrows in the mouth. A knife and a sword were grabbed on the two iron claws. The carving put down the blade hidden weapon and screamed twice to Ying Qiong. At this time, Ying Qiong looked at the sculpture to stand on the ground, which was taller than herself. The gold light flowed on both eyes, and the whole body was black, and Shen Jun was extraordinary. Seeing it is so different, even more surprised. The carving walked in front of the Monk of Baimei, lay down on the ground, and nodded a few points. Monk Baimei said: &quot;</p>
<p>You know that you can get this filial girl, how can she tell her a lot of panic? Get her back and redeem it to prevent you from getting around, she doesn&rsquo;t care about it.&rdquo; The carving heard, Nodded, and slowly walked down to Ying Qiong step by step. Monk Baimei took out three pins from his side and Fu and Yingqiong. Said: &quot;</p>
<p>This Dannai I used to make the grass this time, and one grain of your father&rsquo;s illness. The two of those capsules stayed beside you. In the future, you have your own wonderful use to award your pure filial piety. Now You are a good material, and someone will come to find you soon. Let&rsquo;s go quickly. &ldquo;Ying Qiong was about to answer and thank you. In a blink of an eye, the Monk of the white eyebrow no longer knew where he was going. He had to kneel towards the Maoxu for a while. The little Sami took a grass cable and tied to the carved neck. Yu Yingqiong took the blade hidden weapon and sat up. When this is not comparable, one knows the magic of the god sculpture and the white eyebrow monk; the second will be cured after taking the medicine, and it can also be attributed to the positive fruit. It&rsquo;s really like an arrow, joyful, and not afraid of it.  At present, Xie Bie Xiaosha, sitting on the carved back, holding the grass in one hand, holding the carved winged root tightly in one hand, and one of it rushed into the air. In the blink of an eye, looking at Ningbi Cliff, it was already as small as a mustard, and a small person like an ant. The sculpture suddenly looked back at Ying Qiong, stopped without entering. When Ying Qiong hurriedly looked up, up and down, and saw a cliff on his head, covering the upward road, there was only a small small hole on the left. Knowing that the sculpture is going to pass through this hole, warn yourself. He was busy with your hands forward, hugged the end of the carved two wings tightly, and then clamped the carved chest with your feet. That carving was gathered in both wings, headed up, downward, and worn up from the cave. When it comes down, it is bottomless; now, when I go up, I will not be able to see the sky, and the white is all covered by the clouds. The carving seemed to be a light car, wearing a layer of clouds, and it was a layer of clouds. When she got to a dangerous place, she turned back to Ying Qiong twice so that she would make it early. I love Ying Qiong like life, and can&rsquo;t stop playing with the iron feather steel cricket on the back. It seemed that there was a good time flying on the carved back, and gradually felt that there was a chill on the body, and the snow was found in the cliff concave, and the distance was not far from the distance. Sure enough, it took a while, flying up the cliff, until the cave dropped.
At this time, the mountain was already in the mountains, and Ying Qiong thought of the old father, and did not want to fly away.</p>
<p>Then he said to Naga: &ldquo;Brother Jinyan, you take me to see the master&rsquo;s ancestors, so that my father will be saved, it is really grateful! Please do not go first, go with me to see my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That carving really communicated deeply. Interesting, Ying Qiong held her neck and followed her in front of Li Ning. It happened that Li Ning was still in a coma, and did not know that Ying Qiong went out for half a day. At the moment, Ying Qiong put down the blade hidden weapon and couldn&rsquo;t care about it. She shouted two dads first and did not agree. In a hurry, when I went to the stove to see, the karma was so hot that the karma was cool, and the water was in a hurry to heat the water. I was afraid that the carving would go, while burning the fire, asking for a told. And after Xisan carved into the cave, wherever Ying Qiong went, where he followed, he squatted down. At this time, Ying Qiong was really happy, worried and sad, and I don&rsquo;t know what to do. After a while, boil the water, and get the porridge on the fire. After scooping a bowl of water, he pushed Li Ning for half a wake -up, and poured the Ling Dan and Li Ning who gave him the monk. Holding the carved body in one hand, he looked at his sick father intently. Without a lot of time, he heard Li Ning shouting, &ldquo;Ying&rsquo;er, what can be used for me to eat? I&rsquo;m hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ying Qiongzhi is a wonderful use of spirit, and he is happy in his heart. Three feet and two steps ran to the stove and took the porridge. That carving also jumped into her. After Li Ning took the medicine, he just woke up and felt hungry in his belly, so he called Ying Qiong to pick up food. Seeing a dark shadow shaking, a closer look, in the lighting, a monster with a sharp -eyed golden eye followed the daughter, and when he was anxious, he sweated coldly. I also forgot that I was in illness. I touched the sword of the bedside, leaving only the sword box. Hurrying in his hand, from a step on the bed to the behind Ying Qiong, looking at the monster and hitting. Just listening to Da Da, the original force was too fierce, the monster was not holding, and the previous stone chair in front was split into two halves, and the sword box was also broken into two. The monster jumped twice, screamed twice, and did not escape. Li Ning was very anxious. When she was looking for the blade, Ying Qiong just took the porridge and placed it on the stone table. Suddenly, Li Ning raised it. Hurriedly said, &ldquo;This is the god sculpture of Ningbi Ya Baimei, who sent it to send her daughter, and my father is going to misunderstand. After the illness, please go to bed to eat porridge, let&rsquo;s take a closer look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Li Ning also saw that that there was The monster is a golden eye carving, and after listening to her daughter&rsquo;s words, I was surprised. You can&rsquo;t go to bed to eat porridge, and urge Yingqiong to say.  Ying Qiong asked Li Ning to sit in front of the couch, still holding porridge bowls, serving Li Ning for food, and carefully told the past. Li Ning ate, listening to it, he heard it, he heard it, and was overjoyed. He was so sad that he was very happy. This is really disaster relief and disease. He ate a pot of porridge prepared by Ying Qiong and ate a pot at the bottom of the sky. After hearing it, Li Ning didn&rsquo;t say anything. He hurriedly ran to the sculpture and worshiped: &ldquo;The guests are coming, forgive me to be ignorant. Two points. Li Ningzhong came again, holding Yingqiong and crying, &quot;</p>
<p>Ying&rsquo;er, you are suffering!&rdquo; Ying Qiong Yuan was afraid of the carving anger, and saw that Li Ning stepped forward and apologized. Thinking of the new healing of his father&rsquo;s illness, he couldn&rsquo;t get tired, and he was busy asking Li Ning to go to bed. Li Ning said: &quot;</p>
<p>After I took Lingdan, I felt the cold and the heat retreated, and I was cool. You see that I can eat many things. Now I am 100 times the spirit. hunger. Moreover, the guests arrive, only to serve the patient and forget to entertain the guests. Hurriedly ran into the kitchen, took out a few pieces of waxy odor, cut into thin pieces with a knife, please carve. The carved screamed twice towards Ying Qiong, as if expressed his gratitude. Ying Qiong unravel the rope again and eat it at ease. I cooked some meals again and again, and took leftover vegetables, sitting beside Li Ning, and saw the carving side by side, talking about it. In this stone room, it is full of the joy of Tianlun. It is really bitter, and the haze and shattering scenery are swept away.  When Li Ning saw the sculpture not flying, he knew that he was going to see the white eyebrow monk with him. I couldn&rsquo;t help my heart, I was in a dilemma, I couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh. How clever Yingqiong knew his father&rsquo;s mind. Busy asking: &ldquo;Daddy, you are sick, what kind of mind, so sighing so much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Li Ning only said, &ldquo;There is no mind, Ying&rsquo;er, don&rsquo;t doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ying Qiong said: &ldquo;Daddy still coaxed me Here. You see the god sculpture under the seat of the ancestor of the teacher, and my father and daughter are going to stay away. My father is reluctant to daughter, and he is afraid of the fairy. Ying Qiong also said: &quot;</p>
<p>Daddy wants to rest like this, just rest assured. In front of Cai Ningbi Cliff, her daughter once guessed the ancestors to surpass the ancestors. Xianyuan came to save her daughter. Although Dad will participate in Ningbi Cliff in the future, with this brothers Jinyan, it is not difficult to fly to Wanzhang Shentan. Although her daughter is young, she can&rsquo;t wait to find a master of a sword fairy immediately and practice. Become an amazing ability, go in and out of the air, and fly extinct. It seems that according to the slang of the master&rsquo;s ancestors, it is also first -to -one. In the future, there will be no reunion. What do you worry about? Don&rsquo;t leave Daddy. Since Ningbiya met his ancestor this time, he also hates that his father can become a Tao as soon as possible, and his daughter has also been stained at a little early. As for the suffering of living alone, after seeing the master&rsquo;s ancestor, he said that his daughter was young. Shi Zu ordered this brother Jinyan to accompany his daughter to work hard in the cave and wait for the arrival of fairy.</p>
