    <h1>Twenty -six times Tiger Xiao Dragons, dragons, drag drama waves, swallowing the sea, boiling stone flowing sand</h1>
    <p>Twenty -six times Tiger Xiao Dragons, dragons, drag drama waves, swallowing the sea, boiling stone flowing sand  Dongxiu was looking back at Yueguang, and felt in his heart.</p>
<p>Listening to the sound of the seawater, I saw the rotary of the harbor in front of the lunar light.</p>
<p>The seawater suddenly cracked the giant seam of Xu Kuan, and the waves were separated on both sides.</p>
<p>Among them, a dark shadow was about the water on the surface of the water, and rushed towards the coast of not far away from him.</p>
<p>He rushed and loudly.</p>
<p>When the whole body appeared, Fang saw that the thing was ten feet, and the shape was like a dragon Feilong, which was similar to what the tiger faces I saw in that year, but they had to grow up.</p>
<p>I just didn&rsquo;t see clearly, dazzling, and into the coconut forest.</p>
<p>Fang was surprised, the waves were surging, and two white shadows were raised.</p>
<p>As soon as he met, he asked together, &ldquo;Is Dong Xiu see that thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Dong Xiu saw the second lesbian, he was happy in his heart, and he said what he saw. Sister Erfeng heard the words, let alone answering, and hurriedly chased the edge of the forest. Dongxiu also chased afterwards, chasing half a mile, and the beasts did not catch up. There may be a lion group in secret, and the only child was a little scared, so he had to return to the water. After half an hour, Sister Erfeng turned back. Sanfeng was so anxious to stomach: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not good to blame me. We have captured it together, and I was injured by my arm that was injured the previous year. Escape. You shouldn&rsquo;t take care of this jail knife, not catching up. This thing did not know people before, so catching. Now that you have suffered, you must hide when you see someone. What about Yuecai? &quot;</p>
<p>It was very anxious. Dongxiu is unknown. The second daughter wants to capture that is very good. If you want to ask, he also listens to Erfeng: &ldquo;The three sisters are always anxious. This thing is not only seaweed as the grain. This island is not large. As long as you are willing to spend time, you can always get it. Fortunately, we have found its weaknesses in our inadvertently. What is the use of it? At this time, what is the use of empty sorrow? &quot;</p>
<p>The three were sitting on the stone, saying that they encountered strange things in the sea.  It turned out that Sister Erfeng arrived at the bottom of the water and saw the seaweed in the previous year. I thought: &ldquo;There were many seaweeds the previous year, and this thing was very growing. Even if it was swallowed by the sea underwater, there were about ten miles like this circle, and they would not be eaten by them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The memory is not true. If you read the wrong place, there is still ahead. Thinking about it, I didn&rsquo;t feel a long way to go. Asked or encountered some, it is not very fat and tender. There were a few miles forward, and I suddenly saw that the ancestors were floating in front, and the fish swimming up and down, like shuttle. When I was happy, I pulled the knife wearing the waist in my hand and prepared to step forward. The second daughter was born with a different, and the young mussels were served with old mussels, and the eyes were as keen in the water in the water in the water. I just walked forward for dozens of steps. I suddenly saw that the seaweed clumps spit straight, and the two or three feet -sized circles were spit. Four outside and up and down water still stopped quietly. Within the swirl circle, it is empty. Erfeng has never seen this underwater sky, and has never seen it in her life. She is suspected to have the sea of ​​eyes there. But the water on the swelling circle did not press down, it seemed that there was something invisible to hold the seawater out of thin air, and my heart was strange. The seaweed in that place is particularly long and fat, and the eyes are blocked by algae, which is not clear. In Cuiying, there seemed to be a corner with scales inside, but he didn&rsquo;t see it. Erfeng Bi Sanfeng came to get a police officer, guessing that it was a dragon and a monster in the sea. I just wanted to pull Sanfeng and walked together, not going to have trouble, I cleverly looked at the two very fat and tender seaweeds. They lowered their heads forward, two hands, one point, flattened their body, and rushed to the whistle. I rushed in.  The water can only be directed by hand, not to speak. When Erfeng hadn&rsquo;t held it, when he saw that Sanfeng had rushed in, he was afraid that he had lost, and quickly followed. Seeing that Sanfeng was in front of him, his knife was chopped on the two hypertrophic seaweed. In this dazzling work, a dragon -shaped monster was raised from the seaweed clump next to Sanfeng. It did not hurt people. It was worn on the side. It&rsquo;s terrible. Sister Erfeng often marching in the sea. Strange fish such as ranging whales and crocodile elephants often encounter. It is rare like such things like dragons. I dare not provoke easily. After seeing the place where the thing was, the water van also followed the movement, and the water was near the left of the head, and the water naturally avoided it. When you slowly swim in the side seaweed cluster, you think of where you see it. Thinking about it, it is similar to driving away the lion group on the desert island the previous year, and the tiger -faced monster that siege the sisters. If you do n’t lose it, those evil lions are more than a hundred, and the three sisters do n’t have a lion kiss? At that time, I was busy looking for my father&rsquo;s revenge, and I didn&rsquo;t find the whereabouts of the monster. Later, I asked the islanders, and they all said that they had never seen it, and it would not be mentioned for a long time. I don&rsquo;t want this thing to divide the water. Because this monster used to solve the siege before, and did not see that it had the intention of hurting people, he could not help but reduce the fear of fear. Looking at it again, the seawater outside the four outside was still empty. At the same time, the sisters remembered that this thing had both water division, and it looked quite tame. Is it not a wonderful thing if it could be used to control it and control the turn of the purple cloud palace?  At that time, because I was looking for the bottom of the sea, I was not in time and danger. With the gesture of each other, relying on the things that the things are slow, their talents can not be killed, and the underwater parade is faster than the fish. Who knew that the thing was close to the cluster circle, the thing seemed to be closed and faked, and when he opened his eyes, he saw someone coming, and he was alert to avoid other places. This is the case many times. When the two women saw it swimming quickly, sometimes when she met the large seaweed, she bit her mouth and chewed it. Although avoiding people, there is no maliciousness, and it is more and more daring. After chasing for a long time, it gradually chased and closer. In the last time, Sanfeng saw that thing loved to eat seaweed, and she realized that it was a posture when turning. Just avoid it behind it, and it is not hindered not to be swept by the long tail. Even if it is overwhelmed, there is a way to hide. He fought with Erfeng, and still shocked it from the side by Erfeng, and decided to rush into the empty circle to try it. I found a few slices of hypertrophic seaweed, walked in front of it, and blocked their heads. Holding the horn handle in the right hand, the two large seaweeds were prepared to hand it on the monster&rsquo;s mouth. At this time, because she was close, she was in the air, her feet were on the sea and sand, and she saw that the monster was still in the water, and there was no water around her head in front of her head. Sanfeng is away from the water, and he cannot be freely up and down with the water. The monster was born again. Sanfeng saw that the two were too different. Although the monsters did not hurt people, they looked at such a fierce and fierce form face to face, and they were a little timid. In this hesitant, the monster had lowered his head and opened his mouth to bite. Sanfeng was scared and busy retreating back. Unexpectedly, he was on the muddy bottom of the sea, and a jade foot was trapped in half, and he couldn&rsquo;t pull it out. The monster had opened the mouth of the blood basin and slowly swims. Sanfeng couldn&rsquo;t, with a knife to prepare for the enemy, felt that his left hand moved, and the monster&rsquo;s head stopped suddenly and did not fall. Take a closer look, the two seaweeds drifted several times more than the knife in the hand. Sanfeng raised his left hand because he was anxious and hard -working. The monster did not hurt people, but just rushed to the seaweed in the hands of Sanfeng, just to welcome him. The monster was chewed in the hands of Sanfeng. After eating half, Sanfeng loosened his hand, and turned around by it. At the same time, Erfeng was also rushed into the empty ring from the side. Sanfeng screamed: &ldquo;The second sister pays attention! Here is the extremely sticky sludge, and I have been trapped here. This thing is very tamed. You almost bombard it and let it come in. I get off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned out that the beach on the bottom of the sea was not a mud, but the dung of the whale. Sanfeng was on it, so he couldn&rsquo;t get away. After listening to the words of Sanfeng, Erfeng was busy walking behind the monster, and raised his sword back to the monster&rsquo;s waist. The monster was eating the seaweed in the hands of Sanfeng&rsquo;s hands. He suddenly hurt his head and went towards Erfeng Gong. Erfeng was afraid that it was wild, and he stood in a waterless place, and escaped. Seeing the monster&rsquo;s blood mouth opened, he rushed towards himself, couldn&rsquo;t dodge, and when he was anxious, he hit the monster&rsquo;s face on his face and was beating on the tip of the monster. Erfeng Cai regretted hastily, without using a knife, and using the back of the knife. How can he hurt the monster? It is bound to get angry, and it is more difficult to resist. Thinking of this, he was suddenly clever, and along the back of the monster&rsquo;s nose along the knife, he took a vertical momentum, stepped on the monster&rsquo;s neck, and rode up. It ’s strange to say that when you grow up like that, the evil things are fierce, eat Erfeng with a knife on the nose, and even low the head, obediently lying down the whole body. Erfeng didn&rsquo;t know that the back of this sword was hitting the itch of the monster. Seeing it so tame, he was strange in his heart. He looked forward to looking forward, and Sanfeng still couldn&rsquo;t struggle in the mud. I want to blast the monster so that Sanfeng will get away. Fortunately, you ride on the neck of the monster, not afraid to bite. He raised his knife back to the monster&rsquo;s neck and patted it. He wanted to drive it away. Who knew that the strange thing had a knife because of his nose, and he was on the ground, and he couldn&rsquo;t move. Erfeng drank again and again. After a while, the monster rose on his own and swims to the side seaweed bushes. As soon as the monster left, the seawater still rushed.
As soon as Sanfeng got water, he made his legs out of his legs.</p>
<p>Seeing that Erfeng had rode on the monster and set it up, this joy was really the same, and quickly ran over.</p>
<p>Erfeng knows that monster is amphibious, and he is naked in the sea.</p>
<p>He did not bring a rope.</p>
<p>He wanted to drive the monster to the coast.</p>
<p>Seeing the monster, he slapped his body with a knife, he only took care of the seaweed to eat the seaweed, and ignored it.</p>
<p>There was no way to do it, and he was struggling.</p>
<p>The back of the knife was obliquely.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know where the monsters were.</p>
<p>The monster was in pain.</p>
<p>When the time was wild, it turned around in the water.</p>
<p>At this time, Sanfeng arrived, and the monster lowered his head again, and he had to hit Sanfeng.</p>
<p>Erfeng remembered just now that he was riding in the neck of the monster.</p>
<p>He couldn&rsquo;t hold the head and face of the monster.</p>
<p>The monster was enough this time.</p>
<p>Then he moved forward, raised his hand in the back of his hand, and hit the monster&rsquo;s head and face.</p>
<p>I hit the monster itching place in a coincidence, and immediately collapsed the whole body and lying down.</p>
<p>Erfeng saw that the monster&rsquo;s nose was short.</p>
<p>When the monster stopped for a while, I raised my hand and gave it again, and it was still embarrassed.</p>
<p>He was overjoyed, and shouted, &ldquo;Sanfeng, you can&rsquo;t come up, just use your weapon to press his nose with your weapon, and it will not move.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanfeng heard the words, and then pressed the strange nose with a knife. The monster opened a pair of strange eyes and looked at Sanfeng, and some did not move. Sanfeng had a life -saving grace before, and the boss could not bear it. As soon as his hand was loose, the monster raised his head. Press the back of the knife and kneel again. Erfeng said, &ldquo;You only go to the shore with me, you can practice you, and send my sister to the Ziyun Palace. We will never hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tighten the tip of this monster, don&rsquo;t move. I&rsquo;ll take some seaweed. &ldquo;While saying, jumping down, running into the seaweed clumps, picking the fat and big seaweed, cutting a lot of swimming. When he was about to ride, Sanfeng saw that the monster&rsquo;s nose was pressed by the back of the knife, and his sour tears flowed, and he couldn&rsquo;t help but move his pity. This time, because it took a long time, it took a while before the monster lifted his head and slowly stretched over. Sister Erfeng saw that it was more and more than before, and could not help but prevent it. Erfeng threatened the knife in his hand, holding the seaweed with both hands and feeding it one by one. The monster first chewed two slices slowly in Zero in the left hand of Erfeng, opened his blood basin, and bit the bunch of the bunch in the right hand of Erfeng. Erfeng couldn&rsquo;t dodge and was bitten by it. Thinking that it is more greedy, it was fed to it, and he didn&rsquo;t care much about it. As soon as the monster bites the whole bunch of seaweed, he took off Erfeng&rsquo;s hand, one by one, and fell into the ground.  I did n’t know its intention, while looking down to pick up, and cursed in my mouth, &quot;</p>
<p>I put you a beast that is not bad, and it’ s not bad to practice good things! &quot; In the plan, while Erfeng went to pick up the seaweed, Sanfeng looked at it and could eat it. When Sanfeng saw that he was not good, he was too late to press his nose with a busy back. He was biased by the monster and his mouth opened, just to bite Sanfeng&rsquo;s knife. Where is the human beast that can be assaulting the beast, he was bitten by a monster, and he flew off. Then twisted and escaped. Sanfeng Fang shouted, &quot;</p>
<p>The second sister is coming!&rdquo; The monster had escaped. When I turned around, I almost was swept up by the long tail. Sanfeng picked up the knife underground, with Erfeng, and chased tightly. Although the two women&rsquo;s waters are faster than the monster, helpless monsters have a chance this time, swinging the long tail while walking. Coupled with the water, even if you catch up, people can&rsquo;t hold its nose. Wrap around, chase the place where the two women go to the water, and accidentally swept away by the monster when they turned around. Fortunately, the two women were more flexible than fish in the water. When I got up, the monster had fled on the shore. Quickly caught up ashore, and he had already entered the depths of the coconut forest and did not catch up.  The three women were on the coast, how could they catch the monster. Because this thing is huge, it is not easy to start, discuss it for a while, and there is no good law. In the end, Erfeng turned around and carried the ropes to use wine and vegetables. He was ready to sleep at the beach. When I went, Erfeng, the people on board, etc., because the talents were fighting with the monsters in the sea, it was a bigger way to remove the waves, and there was no other movement. Erfeng was secretly overjoyed, and he ordered everyone not allowed to go ashore. Just waiting on the boat, they turned around. In addition to drinking a little wine, Erfeng and Sanfeng have decided not to eat fireworks. Dongxiu is not used to eating more seaweed, so he cooks meals and eats alone. Sister Erfeng went to the coconut forest from time to time, hoping that the monster would appear and didn&rsquo;t feel it in the middle of the night. At this time, the coast was white, and the beautiful scenery was picturesque. The coconut tree is as high as 20 to 30 feet, and the Bigkai Pavilion is on the ground with moonlight, and dances with breeze. Coupled with the sound of the lion roar, the time is far away, and the more you feel the more wild fun. The three women are facing the coast, talking and drinking, and laughing. Dongxiu saw the black clouds on the road at a glance, and suddenly became bigger and bigger, becoming a long strip, like an oolong, a straight sea surface, dense and thick. The moonlight beside the clouds reflects the countless five -color clouds. From time to time, tens of millions of golden light and red lines are seen. The clouds of the seaside have become impermanent, and the wonders of the bonus, especially the hurricane, will be the most. As a wonderful scene like tonight, I have never seen it for three years in Anle Island, and I can&rsquo;t help but see God. When Sanfeng saw her stop drinking, he stared at the sky, and asked with a smile: &quot;</p>
<p>What about the good moonlight all year round. We discuss things, but do you look like this?&rdquo; Dongxiu said: &quot;</p>
<p>You see, see This cloud reflects the moonlight, but it becomes black golden color, how good it is! &quot;  Without a word, he listened to the wind, and the tide of the sea seemed to kill thousands of horses. The coconut forests on the shore were swinging, and the undulating was like a tide. Suddenly, the moonlight was suddenly hidden, and the earth was dark immediately, and the five fingers reached out. The ground on the bottom of the feet was a little shaking. Sister Erfeng and Dongxiu are both young and have little experience. They have never seen any great battles. When Fang was so panicked, he suddenly heard a big shock again, and his feet shaking again and again. Dongxiu fell first. Erfeng heard the sound, and Fang reluctantly lifted her. She hadn&rsquo;t stood yet, and a wave of waves had been hit like a mountain. The three women couldn&rsquo;t support it and fell together. I struggled barely, and stepped back. The sound of the blasting explosion was endless and deafening. The three women have not retreated a few steps, and the talents are sitting. Suddenly, she collapsed flat, and she broke down and fluttered. At the light flash, the shadow of the beast bugs and snakes often scrambled in the broken forest. At this time, thunderstorms, coupled with the sound of landslides, and the roar of the beasts, I saw many eyes or blue or red, a pair of pairs, a group of groups, and fluttered in the distance. Broken wood and stones on the coast were rolled out of the wind, dancing and flying, hitting their heads, and the brain was cracking immediately. It was still a pair of God&rsquo;s eyes that were born with a pair of gods. Except for a lot of gravels on the body, it has not been injured.  After a while, Erfeng thought of such a earthquake and was horrified on the shore. Why did he preserve three lives without the bottom of the water? Thinking of this, even shouting, all the sounds of wind and ground cracks were chaotic, and Sanfeng and Dongxiu were unknown opposite. When Erfeng was anxious, he had to do one hand and pulled forward. In this case, Sanfeng and Dongxiu also suddenly realized that they rushed to the sea together and jumped out of the sea with waves. Tour out of the harbor and arrived in Qianhai, the probe went out to find all the time, where there is a big boat. The three were in the depths of the water, although the hydraulic was several times greater, it was not very difficult. As soon as the body was exposed, the waves of mountains and mountains were all beaten with the other. How can manpower be banned? The most bitter thing is Dongxiu. He just went to the sea. When he saw the big boat, he didn&rsquo;t know where to go. Then he looked back. There is only a land in Anle Island in the sea. This earthquake must be a volcanic outbreak. The island will not be sinking, and the island&rsquo;s life and property on the island will not be ashes? It took myself to work hard, and it was still empty. The sea of ​​bitterness is vast, there is no place, and it is sore in my heart. I was sorry for crying, and the intention of watching the eye -catching watches suddenly came again. If Sister Erfeng knows that she is too far away, she will be held at any time. Erfeng&rsquo;s eyes were fast, and when she saw the waves, she was busy holding her down, and she avoided it. At the same time, Erfeng also saw that the volcano of Anle Island collapsed, and then handed Dongxiu to Sanfeng, comparing the gestures, and asked them to take a surgery and plan to swim to the circuit and see a movement.  Erfeng is less than ten miles, the seawater is getting hot, and the hotter goes forward. The probe went out and looked at it from a distance, where there was island shadow, pure fire peak, and the candle was heavy. It was like the water on the sea, and there were many corpses drifting from time to time. The sound of the explosion increased the sound of wind and the tsunami, and it was righteous. Except for fire and boiling waves, nothing can be observed. Gradually, the body was immersed in hot water, and it was so hot that he couldn&rsquo;t even get angry. I didn&rsquo;t dare to stay again, I had to go back to the bottom of the sea. Although the body feels colder, the sand mud on the bottom of the sea is not like plain and calm, and it is turbid. It didn&rsquo;t feel better until the back to the original place. The three women gathered in one place, and it was not good at first. In Dongxiu, one person cannot be switched on the bottom of the water. After a while, he must be supported by Sister Erfeng to the sea to change his breath. The winter show floated and fascinated, looking at the island country, the flames rushed, and the mountains were standing. The wind and waves in the ears were roaring, and the bombardment turned into a loud noise. It was like the fall of the sky, dizzy, and the six gods had no master. When I was so sad, I wanted to cry without tears, and I just died with the support of Sister Erfeng.
After half an hour, the volcano on the island suddenly rushed a green smoke and rose to the air.</p>
<p>Then he listened to the tsunami in the storm, and his voice became more and more flushed.</p>
<p>At this time, Sister Erfeng just helped Dongxiu to rise to the sea, changed his breath, and landed down.</p>
<p>There was also Xu Ying in the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>Erfeng guessed that the bottom of the sea was stunned by volcanic shocks, and it collapsed at the same time.</p>
<p>I ca n’t talk about the water in the water.</p>
<p>I hate it to see that the earthquake in the island country cracks.</p>
<p>As soon as he moved, he was busy with the gesture and Sanfeng.</p>
<p>He pinched the Dongxiu alone, and escaped in a hurry to the back of the volcano.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the water is getting hotter, the sea is strange and salty.</p>
<p>There is no hundred miles away, and Hugh said that Dongxiu couldn&rsquo;t support it.</p>
<p>He had already fainted.</p>
<p>Even Sister Erfeng gave birth to the bottom of the sea and regarded Hong Tao as the heterogeneity.</p>
<p>In the middle, fighting desperately with the boundless heat waves and survival of the way.</p>
<p>After this major journey, I was exhausted and dangerous.</p>
<p>It was easy and barely struggling with more than a hundred miles.</p>
<p>Seeing that it was deep in front, the surrounding seawater turned from heat to cooling, and gradually escaped the heat wave hell.</p>
<p>Then he hurriedly rose to the sea, wanted to find a landing place, rescue Dongxiu back, and rest and breathe.</p>
<p>Who knew that although the volcano had two or three hundred miles around, it was just that the sound of the tsunami mountains was relatively small.</p>
<p>The upper and lower vast, the sea and the sky are connected, the waves are turbulent, and there is no border.</p>
<p>There is a shadow of land.</p>
<p>The sister of Erfeng is very friendly, although it is difficult to support, and still reluctant to reluctantly.</p>
<p>I always want to save Dongxiu to return to the sun, and she must choose a good place to bury her in a good place.</p>
<p>Both sisters are the same psychology.</p>
<p>Although they are doing hard work, no one is willing to let go.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there is no need to escape from the heat waves.</p>
<p>Although the water waves are large, it is calm and laborious in deep water.</p>
<p>The two women marched on the water, and from time to time, they rose out of the sea to explore the future.</p>
<p>Torn Dongxiu&rsquo;s clothes again and stuffed it in her mouth.</p>
<p>Every time I went out of the sea, I vomited her water.</p>
<p>Seeing that Dongxiu was in the air, there was still removal of temperature.</p>
<p>Later, the chest gradually became cold, his hands and feet were stiff, two fists were tight, his nails were deeply gripped, his complexion turned from white to gray -green, and a lot of seawater was swollen in the abdomen.</p>
<p>After a while in the water, I never saw the shadow of land.</p>
<p>I had to change my thoughts and planned to choose a hole in the underwater reef and buried her.</p>
<p>In case she could turn around the Ziyun Palace, and then compared.</p>
<p>The second woman discussed on the sea and dived directly to the bottom of the sea to find a place where the winter show was buried.</p>
<p>Who knew that since the tsunami escaped from the heat waves, it was walking in the center of the seawater because of the sediment of the bottom of the water, and there was no bottom.</p>
<p>The deeper the seawater, the deeper the seawater, and the two women&rsquo;s together did not feel.</p>
<p>Until the depth of the sinking, the pressure was gradually felt, and the pressure could not be dived.</p>
<p>After a while, I thought of the deep method of the water here.</p>
<p>Could it be that it was above the Ziyun Palace?</p>
<p>I was contemplating, and I suddenly saw that there were many white shadows flashing.</p>
<p>Looking at it, it is a group of tiger sharks.</p>
<p>There are a few feet long, and the small ones are also swimming from the opposite side.</p>
<p>This shark is the most cruel and murderer.</p>
<p>The fish in the sea met it and had no life.</p>
<p>Specializing in weak meat and strong food, hunger is the same kind, but also the same disabled.</p>
<p>The boat boat navigation in the sea approached the shark -producing area.</p>
<p>People did not dare to walk along the bench.</p>
<p>If they were not careful, they would be swallowed by it.</p>
<p>The two women used to encounter it before and know that it was powerful, so I traveled accidentally, carrying the front paws of the shrimp, in order to encounter the use of powerful fish.</p>
<p>One is naturally divine and can be resisted; that is, or when you meet a group of evil fish, you can escape from the parade quickly.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the two women have exhausted this time, and they are in the extreme; they have been in the island for three years, and the fireworks have eaten more.</p>
<p>The heterogeneous funeral was too much.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help but panic when I encountered so many and so fierce things.</p>
<p>In this blink of an eye, the shark group has a hundred and ten, and the industry has raised the fins and wings, spraying foam like clouds, giant mouth open, Ruya Senlie, Fei seemed to come over, only ten feet away from him.</p>
<p>When the two women were not good, they quickly turned and fled.</p>
<p>Just eating, how sharks are willing to give up, and they are tightly rushed behind.</p>
<p>The two women were in a lack of support, and they did not go well.</p>
<p>In addition, the hand clip hindered her hands.</p>
<p>It was not time to do it.</p>
<p>At this crisis, Sanfeng thought: &ldquo;Things are urgent. In addition to throwing the bodies of Dongxiu as a bait, the sisters are desperately escaping into the oblique thorns, or there is a line of hope. . &quot;</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I do n’t think about it. The left hand is fighting at Erfeng, with a loose right hand, a wave of two hands from both hands, and when the body is flexed and stretched, he uses the strength of his feet to slap down the bottom of the left side. Sister Erfeng was one person holding the bodies of winter shows and connecting side by side. Erfeng was forgetting his life and fled. Seeing that Sanfeng&rsquo;s hand was raised, he sank on the left winter show. Looking at Sanfeng again, she also escaped from below the oblique. Erfeng knew that she was going to abandon Dongxiu&rsquo;s body to escape. Darkness: &ldquo;Winter Xiu spent trouble with himself, and he was more fleshy. He said that he had discarded each other, and he couldn&rsquo;t bear it, and these tiger sharks were very fierce. In addition to meeting like in the past, use shrimp claws to brachy his eyes and blindly. Regardless of people or fish, they have always had to be more than. Instead of abandoning Dongxiu, it is still inevitable that the belly of the fish is buried. Lost balance, even more slow to work.  Speaking of time, at that time, it was fast. Just for a moment when Erfeng Xun thought, the big tiger shark industry in the back was getting closer and closer, and the long thorns of the front lip had to be next to Erfeng&rsquo;s feet. Erfeng felt that the soles of his feet were slightly painful. When he was busy, he looked back. Behind the lips of the tiger shark behind him, he opened his mouth and opened his mouth. At the same time, the body was absorbed by the fish mouth, and some had receded. Surly, it was swallowed by it. The blade in his hand has long been lost, and he can&rsquo;t resist, and he can&rsquo;t help but scare the soul. Dongxiu pulled in his hand was impulsive in the shark&rsquo;s mouth, sinking into the side, and it was even more strenuous. In the danger, it was a sudden manner, and it was no longer there when I turned back and fled back. I was busy with the sinking of the corpse of Dongxiu. The tiger shark chased for a while, all parallel, seeing the food can reach the mouth, the drum fin raises the wings, and the illness is near Erfeng. I just opened my mouth to bite, but I did not expect Erfeng to be in the middle of the wisdom. It happened to make the fish head. Erfeng was seeking life during death, and I do n’t know if she was dangerous. She pulled Dongxiu&rsquo;s corpse with one hand and rushed down. go. This was on the fish item. Erfeng felt that the bottom of the feet was as hard as iron, thinking that he was close to the fish, and said secretly: &quot;</p>
<p>Not good!&rdquo; Dongxiu in his hand also took off his hand. Both feet are more forceful, desperately rushing down, illness like electric flashes, and fled deep into the heart of the Haixin. The shark came too fiercely, and his body grew very much. Although the parade quickly, it was inconvenient to turn to the side. When he was chasing, Erfeng escaped.  Many of the fierce and similar species in the back, seeing the food in front of it is almost the first big fish mouth, all of them are in a hurry. The big fish turned over again, the waves on the sea were turbulent, and the high rush was like a mountain, and the water heart was like clouds and foggy. In the turbulent waves, the group of fish did not see that the food had escaped clearly. It was thought that it fell into the mouth of the big fish. There are two other people who grew up in the inside. They were headed by this big suddenly, and a fishtail tail hit each other. The latter two refused to be Ganfu, biting the mouth headed, and the latter collision in the unconsciousness, embracing each other, and hitting each other. This rushing, the mouth and ends, the bite could not be used, but instead of the food did not chase, the same kind was disabled.  These evil fish are sharp and better than swords. Whether the fish is small, the scales are used to remove a large piece of meat. This fierce battle was hit from the sea to the sea, and from the sea to the sea again. I saw the blood waves flying, the silver scales flashed, and the sea water around the nearby became red. These evil fish are desperately fighting, and they are injured and weak, and they are endless, and they do not care about it.</p>
