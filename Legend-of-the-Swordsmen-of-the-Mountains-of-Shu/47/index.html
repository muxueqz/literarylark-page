    <h1>Forty6th round of the ancient temple of the ancient temple fighting zombies to play plum blossoms to capture the dragon and get the sword</h1>
    <p>Forty6th round of the ancient temple of the ancient temple fighting zombies to play plum blossoms to capture the dragon and get the sword  It is said that Li Yingqiong was busy with the monster with the temple tiles, only listening to the card, the monster called twice, and the more he showed his anger, it seemed that he had never hurt anything.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the hall was disrepairing for a long time, and the Liang Liang had rotten.</p>
<p>Because the monster grabbed the tile ridge, his body was hung in the air, and he couldn&rsquo;t go up.</p>
<p>He was anxious, and the entire roof was broken by it, and even the monster fell to the ground together.</p>
<p>At this time, Ying Qiong was frightened, his eyes watched in all directions.</p>
<p>Preventing this side, I just planned to find a way to escape, and suddenly saw the monster who fell in the drum pile.</p>
<p>From the tattered drums, picked up a three -foot, four or five -inch white wooden boxes, boxes.</p>
<p>It is faintly seen that the painting has a symbol.</p>
<p>This kind of zombie is the most cruel and murderous.</p>
<p>Seeing that people who want to eat can&rsquo;t get the hand, they have been stumbled by the wooden box, getting more angry.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, he took the wooden box in his hand and grabbed it in between, and was divided into two halves.</p>
<p>When you still want to crush it again, the wooden box is broken, and the purple light rushes, and the monster&rsquo;s waist is only around, and when he screams, he is divided into two sections and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The two monsters falling from the eaves had to be climbed up, and when they had to go up, they suddenly heard the sound of their companions.</p>
<p>When the three monsters looked back together, they saw that their companion industry had been cut to the ground.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, a group of greens and purple fogs appeared like a dragon and non -dragon.</p>
<p>Those three monsters want to know that they are powerful, and they can no longer find someone to eat, and they escape.</p>
<p>The purple dragon rolled over, and when the three monsters were next to it, there were only one roll around, and the sound of rolling turned into a pile of white bone skeletons to dismantle the ground.</p>
<p>In addition to the four monsters, Angtou looked up at the ridge and saw Ying Qiong, and the arrows came up.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong only looked at the monster to fight against the dragon, and he forgot the danger of the situation.</p>
<p>At this moment, it was urgent to think of: &ldquo;Those monsters are just a few dead bones. Although they have become essentials for a long time, they cannot jump high and dwarf. They can also avoid it. This demon dragon is one. In the blink of an eye, remove the four monsters, and it will be even more powerful. Don&rsquo;t escape, when will you wait? &quot;</p>
<p>Thinking of this, he put his body hard, put on the temple wall first, and then jumped. At this time, the dragon was not far from her. Ying Qiong felt that the cold cold struck, knowing that the dragon was not far behind, and did not dare to neglect. He usually fled to Merlin in front of the temple. The dragon was about seven or eight feet behind her, chasing tightly. Ying Qiong turned back to see that the dragon was about three feet long, and she had a long nose of three feet long on her head. She was full of purple light and green smoke. Ying Qiong was anxious to escape, how dare to look at it carefully. Because the dragon grew up, he looked for the dense branch to escape. At this time, it was already three times. The Merlin in front of the temple is about three miles. Under the moonlight, the breeze is bursting, the jade crumbs are hazy, the color is good, and the snow is bright. This purple dragon, a red girl girl, ran away in this Crystal Palace and Xiangxuehai, but only shocked the kingfisher&rsquo;s shock, and Mei Yu flew. In the purple light of that dragon, the plum branches fell, and it was stuck.  Ying Qiong watched Na Long&rsquo;s chasing tightly, scared and cracked, and cursed: &ldquo;Chichengzi Niu Niu Lao Tao, throwing me alone here, hurting me so hard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was running away, I saw that Merlin was even more than seeing Merlin. A dense, a large plum tree is in front of himself. Afterwards, he passed by the branches. After running in the middle of the night, I was panicked, my body was fatigue, and I was accidentally stuck when I landed. Looking at the dragon again, it will come from the tree power. I couldn&rsquo;t help but sigh, &ldquo;I will rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time, Ying Qiong Shen was exhausted. Speaking, he couldn&rsquo;t even move. Ying Qiong consciously turned into a foreign body. Who knew that the dragon moved for a long time. Just listening to the sound of the wind, a burst of cold plums and fragrance, and pushing into the nose with the wind. When I looked at it quietly, I saw that the moon was full of light, and the stars were in the sky. The plum trees in front were shaking without wind, and the plum blossoms were like snow and fog. When looking at the tree right, the dragon wanted to be too anxious, sandwiched between the large plum trees, could not advance and retreat, swing back and forth, and was anxious to get rid of the spirit.  Ying Qiong was finally shocked. He knew that this was a good opportunity for heaven, and he couldn&rsquo;t care about it. He stood up and wanted to find a big stone to kill the dragon. After finding it for a while, the stones on the mountain were the smallest of four or five feet high, and the weight of a hundred pounds could not be applied. Ying Qiong watched Naolong Yueyue, and the root of Gumei gradually loosened, and she was about to get rid of it. At this time, she was next to a big stone, and she was eager to hit the psor handles that could come to the stone. I only heard it, the boulder with five or six feet cubes cracked. When Yingqiong was at first suspected, it was accidental, and when he tried to try the other big stone with the hilt, it all broke through, so he knew that he had inadvertently got a strange treasure. Being happy, the dragon shook even more. Nearly a hundred plum trees on the left, with the ups and downs of the faucet, like Yun Tao&rsquo;s anger, lustful. Suddenly, the first ends of the end, only one arched upwards. This thousand -year -old plum that can be held and shaded with a large number of acres was brought up in the air for more than ten feet high. The dragon hovered only in the air, and fell off the plum trees sandwiched on it. How can the first plum blossoms be able to withstand such a huge shock. They separated from the branches, gently rushed with the wind, fell into the wind, and the five colors were colorful, just like sprinkled with the rain for a day. Looking at the moonlight, it looks eye -catching. It wasn&rsquo;t until the tree was wearing half a cup of tea that the flower rain had to be finished, and it turned into spring mud. Although Ying Qiong was frightened, she could not help but see such a wonderful scene. Speaking late, at that time, the dragon got rid of the tree, and seemed to be trapped. Ying Qiong saw the purple light, and the dragon flew beside him, knowing that his life was in a moment, and he was panicked. Fighting, faintly seeing a fire, beating. Just listen to Dang Dang twice, Ziguang flashed. Ying Qiongming knows that this demon dragon is not a dart, and there is no equipment in his hands. In a hurry, I saw that there were two boulders next to them, and the intersection was like a hole, about a few feet high. At the moment, there was no time to count whether the dragon was injured. He hurriedly lowered his head. He had just traveled in, his eyes were flowing, and he saw a white monster standing on the opposite side. Just because he was too fierce, he couldn&rsquo;t retreat, and couldn&rsquo;t hold his feet. He hit the white monster&rsquo;s hands, and he felt the head of his head and brain was sore. Listening to the air sculpture in the ears, I was happy in my heart. Running out of the cave to take a look, the white monster has been pecked to death by the sculpture. One carved and one dragon was fighting in the air, and the scales were flying messy, regardless of the up and down. When Ying Qiong was injured, he was so distressed that he was so distressed that he took the crossbow next to him and shot it towards Naolong&rsquo;s two eyes. The dragon suddenly glanced at Ying Qiong&rsquo;s arrow below, a rotation, gave up the god carving, stretched out two dragon claws, and rushed directly to Ying Qiong. Ying Qiong panicked, &ldquo;Ouch&rdquo;</p>
<p>, fell into a large water pond next to him. I was not familiar with the water. For a moment of floating in the water, I only felt that it was cold, and the water poured straight into the mouth. In a hurry, &ldquo;」 &quot;</p>
<p>, woke up and woke up. The sunlight was on the face. I slept next to a water. The flower shadow is away, and the sun has been shot in from the stone seam. It turned out that the area before and after the hole was only promised. In the thoughtfulness, I thought of being brought to this mountain yesterday by Akihiko, and fought with the monster and demon dragon overnight at night. Remember to escape into this stone cave and meet another white monster and knock yourself down. Isn&rsquo;t it a dream? Thinking of this, I was afraid that the demon dragon would not be waiting outside, and I dare not go out of the front. Standing up quietly, feeling pain in the whole body, the upper body was immersed in the water, and the industry was wet. After a while, I didn&rsquo;t see the movement. The green birds on the plum trees are noisy, and the mountains are silent. Except for the spring birds, there is no other slightest movement. After giving the breath, gently run out of the hole, and see the plum blossoms in the mountains, Wenxiang is rich, straight through the nose. Sometimes when the branches trembled slightly, there were three or two plum blossoms falling, which showed a lot of interest. Watching Mei this day, another wonderful situation.
In this doubt, Ying Qiong did not intentionally watch, and planned to explore the battlefield yesterday after the cave.</p>
<p>Not far away, I saw the grave on the underground mud, one of them, there were two or three feet deep, and there were countless falling flowers around.</p>
<p>Vaguely remember that there was a major plum tree here last night, and the dragon was caught here.</p>
<p>Later, the plum tree was pulled up, and after getting away, I chased myself again.</p>
<p>Not far ahead, it really lays the ancient plum trees under the ground, and there are countless unbroken flower bones on it.</p>
<p>Store, Mao will be attached, and still there are still colorful and smile.</p>
<p>The grass and trees are ignorant, and this does not care about it.</p>
<p>In addition, Ying Qiong came all the way, and she was full of disabled branches, and flowers were all over the ground.</p>
<p>Yesterday&rsquo;s dangerous battle was still in my calendar, so I knew that the first half of last night was not a dream.</p>
<p>Walking around, I didn&rsquo;t feel until the temple yesterday, and I looked in inwardly.</p>
<p>The bell tower in front of the courtyard collapsed.</p>
<p>There were only a pile of white bones in front of the rubble.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t dare to look at it again, go back and run.</p>
<p>I thought in my heart, &ldquo;There are many monsters here at night, Akashizi does not come back, and I don&rsquo;t recognize the path. What is it in this deserted mountain murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Essence After crying for a while, I felt a little hungry in my belly. I wanted to take the surplus of He Shouwu, took out and chewed hunger, and reached out and touched my arms. I thought of last night in the belly of the bell tower, I got a horn handle, a baby. Last night, I had mistakenly regarded it as a gold dart to fight the demon dragon. Now I do n’t see the demon dragon, presumably it must be repelled by the sword handle. Is this treasure so wonderful, but it is unfortunately lost? Regardless of the hunger in his belly, he ran to find the two big stones just now. I just walked away from those two big stones and Zhang Xu Yuan and near. Under the sun, I suddenly saw a purple light flashing. It was suspected that the demon dragon had not yet escaped, and frightened and fled. When I ran out for a hundred steps, I did n’t see the movement, and my heart was hard to give up. When I was quietly approaching the road step by step, the purple light was still competing. Dad looked boldly, and it turned out to be a long sword. Looking at it in my hand, the handle of the sword was generally the same as what I saw yesterday, and the sword head was engraved with &ldquo;Ziru&rdquo;.</p>
<p>How can this sword become a sword? It&rsquo;s strange. I tried it in my hand, and I was very happy. As soon as he waved, there was a ten -long purple light. A big jump of Yingqiong, almost drunk away. Seeing that the sword was so different, she tried it. When she danced, she had more than ten feet purple light, reflecting the sunlight. Take a closer look and can&rsquo;t help but be ecstatic. Unfortunately, there is no sword box with such a sip of the best -like treasure.  Ying Qiong was worried that she had no blade, and suddenly she accidentally got such a magical thing, and could not help but boldly. I thought: &ldquo;There is both a sword, is there no box? Why not find everywhere on this mountain? Maybe it is unknown to find it. Fortunately, there is a sword on the body, and it is a blue sky and day, and the monster is not afraid of the monster.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lu Xun, Xun Xun, found the lying plum tree before, and had already walked over, and suddenly the sword in his hand could not hold the earthquake. Looking back, seeing that a thing in the tree gap was shining under the sunlight. Looking forward, a sword box was sandwiched in the gap. This suddenly realized that the dragon in the drum last night was the sword. I like it again, and I am scared again: joy is to have this god, bringing on the side. From then on, I learn the swords in the mountains. Looking closely at the sword handle, it is generally the same as the things that were lost yesterday. Remember that last night, I used this hilt to fight the demon dragon. I felt that there was a fire. Is there a fire? After thinking about it for a while, after all, I was hard to give up, so I took the sword box nearby. Because of the deep seam of the wood, Ying Qiong waved with a sword in his hand, cut off the tree and dropped the sword box. Insert the sword into the box, it happens to be seamless, but it is appropriate. The remaining Shouwu, I ate half of the Xiyuzhongshan Spring. The sword was pulled out of the practice sword, and the purple light was shining, reflecting the sunlight, and the endless color was illuminated. As soon as I moved my bones and bones, I was not sore on my body, so I found a stone in Merlin and took a rest. I wanted to leave that temple and find another stone cave as a place to settle, and I am afraid that Chichengzi returns to find himself; if you want to leave here, I am afraid that I will meet ghosts again. After thinking for a while, I couldn&rsquo;t do it. Thinking of the wrapping, sword, and silver, the bell tower is still collapsed, and the bell tower has collapsed. Presumably it is in the rubble pile. Mo Ru take advantage of this day, take it out first and then stop. At the moment, the purple sword was in his hand, and the sword pocket was beside him, and he was bravely moved forward. Go closer to find two stones and beat it towards the pile of skeletons. When I approached, the piles of skeletons were sunny, and many yellow water flowed out of the sun. Ying Qiong raised his sword in one hand, pinched his nose in one hand, walked to the rubble pile of the bell tower, and the wrapping and sword were still there. He was not torn by the monster, so he took it beside him. Don&rsquo;t dare to stay again, get out of the wall. Immediately take out the clothes from the package, replace the wet clothes and wrap it, and carry it on your body. After waiting for a while, it was not the beginning of the beginning of the beginning, and Akihiko hadn&rsquo;t seen the turn. Thinking of the danger last night, I still had a lingering in my heart, and I didn&rsquo;t dare to stay here. I decided to leave the mountain while the sky was not dark. I thought: &ldquo;Chichengzi and that female sword fairy want to accept me as an apprentice, and I will definitely go to Emei to find me again. I leave here and is really forced by the monsters. Presumably they must not blame me. Go down the mountain, look for someone, and then inquire about the journey. &quot;</p>
<p>After the idea was determined, after looking at the Japanese shadow, he walked from the mountain trail to the mountain. Where did she know that this reckless mountain was hundreds of miles, and she continued, and she did not make the path. She had a mountain and a mountain. Sometimes the path is wrong, and we must distinguish the wind direction and go back. It seemed that she reached the peak and went down the mountain. Although she was as light as a swallow, she also walked all over her body and made her body. Go straight to dusk, just go out for sixty or seventy miles. I couldn&rsquo;t recognize the way at night, so I had to find a shelter and rest for a night. It seemed that the mountains stayed for more than ten days, and still did not go out of this mountain. And the Zihuo Sword made by the joy has not changed, and he did not meet any ghosts and tigers along the way. Moreover, this mountain scenery is beautiful. Except for Meilin Chang, the yellow essence, He Shouwu, Songren, hazel chestnuts, and many unknown and delicious results are everywhere. Ying Qiong regards these yellow essence as food. Each time I discovered, I always packed a large bag, enough for three or five days to eat, and then meals a meal. When you encounter new ones, you will abandon the old and new. How many days do not eat fireworks and eat this kind of fitness and prolonged things. I feel that I am light and comfortable. I only worry that this mountain can&rsquo;t be finished, when can I return to Emei? Thinking of this, as soon as it was ruthless, I walked dozens of miles on this day. Before the as usual, you have to make a place to settle down. Who knows that the hills on this day are actually a bald mountain and there is no ideal hiding place. At a glance on the hill, I suddenly saw a peak on the opposite side. It looked at the trees, and faintly saw a mountain concave. Fortunately, it was not far from each other, so he took it away, and it was really a forest. The strangest thing is that in the middle of Maolin, there is an avenue, about one foot wide. In the middle of the road, the grass is not born. The ancient tree beside the road was near the abbot, and the traces of abrasions appeared everywhere. In the end, Ying Qiong has not been able to understand. He has never seen tiger and leopard on the way, and his courage is getting bigger and bigger. Seeing that this big road is about a hundred feet long, there is a hill wall at the end, so you don&rsquo;t think about it. When you look closer, it turns out that the lonely wall stands, and a large stone about three feet high is beside the road. Looking at this stone again, there was a cave that appeared in Zhang Xu Fang, and he was happy. Just because of the sleeping day, it is either a valley, or the belly of the tree, often being abused by the wind, and it is easy to meet such a good place for the wind. He walked in without thinking, just happened to have a seven or eight -foot -wide square boulder next to the cave, and sat down on it and took out the mountain fruit and yellow essence along the road and chewed it slowly.
After a while, a round of bright moon was hung on the treetops, and the moonlight shot the hole obliquely.</p>
<p>It faintly saw the deep part of the hole, with a bunch of black and furry things.</p>
<p>With a movement in my heart, I gradually recalled the danger of a few days ago, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but be afraid of it.</p>
<p>I took a stone first and hit the piles of black things.</p>
<p>With a bang, it seemed to hit something soft, and it was estimated that it was a pile of dirt to relax the heart.</p>
<p>Then wrapped the parcel as a pillow, pressed the sword under his body, lying there and looked at the moon.</p>
<p>The young man was asleep as fast, and he took the mountains to do it.</p>
<p>He fell asleep without knowing it.</p>
<p>Sleeping until the middle of the night, Ying Qiong heard a sound.</p>
<p>When I woke up, the weather was very dark.</p>
<p>The sword I beloved fell underground, and the purple light was shining.</p>
<p>I want to be accidentally in my sleep.</p>
<p>Ying Qiong loved the sword and loved his life, and returned it to his arms.</p>
<p>Seeing that the sky was still dark, he fell down again before sleeping.</p>
<p>Somehow, I can&rsquo;t sleep over and over.</p>
<p>I barely closed my eyes to raise my God, and felt that my sinking was burnt, as if my mind was uncertain.</p>
<p>Thinking secret: &ldquo;The moonlight these days is very good. Why will it be so dark today? It was not far away from the entrance of the cave, so I wanted to reach out to try it outside the cave. When I was about to touch the cave from the darkness, who knew that the sword on the stone stunned again, and a purple light flashed with Zhang Xu, which shocked Yingqiong. The suspicion of the sword was going to fly away again, and he could no longer look at the sky. When he hurriedly came over, when he grabbed the sword into his hand, the sword had been out for no reason, and Ying Qiong was shocked. Thinking of it: &quot;</p>
<p>In the past, I often heard my dad said that any of the rare puppet swords must be alarmed in advance when encountering dangerous things. This sword has been deeply spiritual. I just stunned in my sleeping dream just now. Should the fierce sign on my head? &ldquo;The sword in the opponent said,&rdquo;</p>
<p>You really have spiritual response, if I have to meet something bad tonight, you will sound again. &quot; There was a loud sound, half out of the box, and in the purple light shadow, I didn&rsquo;t feel it was on the stone in front of it. Ying Qiong was shocked and thought to himself, &quot;</p>
<p>I remember this is the hole in yesterday, where did the stones come from?&rdquo; So Sheng was surprised. Touching it recently, it was a large stone, and the industry closed the cave door. Try to push it away with your hands. I am afraid that this stone is tens of thousands of pounds, just like the dragon&rsquo;s shaking the stone pillar. Can&rsquo;t help but sweat in a cold sweat. I was anxious in my heart, and once, I saw a white light underground, which was startled. When Dingqing looked at it, it turned out that the light of the sun was shot obliquely. It was understood that the time was not too early. There is sunlight in the cave, and the scenery in the cave can be discerned. Last night, I thought it was a black thing that was a dumplings. It turned out to be the fur and bone corner of some beasts. It was piled in the corner of the cave, about seven or eight feet high, and it was unpleasant.  Seeing that the cave door was blocked by a stone, Ying Qiong wanted to find another way. First release the Zi Sword, dance all the way, look all the way to the cave, and find the way through the sunlight and the purple light from the sword. This hole was trapped, and I couldn&rsquo;t help but be disappointed. It turned out that this hole was a dead hole. I was so anxious like a flies with window paper, and there was no way. Knowing that this hole is not good, the more you think about it, the more scared in your heart. Sitting on the stone, the sun shot in the stone seam for a while. Suddenly scolding myself: &quot;</p>
<p>Stupid, I don&rsquo;t climb high and short, why not climb out of the stone seam?&rdquo; From this haze, I suddenly found that this line of vitality was doubled. It happened that there was a lot of stones in the stone. Ying Qiong tried it with his hands and had a vertical body, and he had climbed the gap. Compared with that caliber, the widest is less than four inches. It can only be seen outside, but it is more difficult to go out than the sky. The heart is heavy and anxious. Unconsciously, when I looked out from the gap, I saw a giant on the mountain on the opposite side, naked upper body, two hands empty, watching its footsteps, and walking towards this mountain. Ying Qiong was happy in his heart, and was about to call for help. He thought about it: &quot;</p>
<p>I walked in this mountain for many days without meeting a trace of human beasts. This mountain is about half of the mountains. And the man did not wear clothes, not a monster, but also a savage. &ldquo;Thinking of this, he dared not speak out and became cold.  Between the thoughts, the man had moved towards the mountain here, and it was really tall and abnormal. Ying Qiong couldn&rsquo;t help but screaming &quot;</p>
<p>叫&rdquo;, which was scared and almost lost. When looking at the giant, I came towards the Shidong side. The towering trees that could be hugged along the road hindered some footsteps, and it was pulled up by it, even the roots and pulled down the road. Ying Qiong realized that the big trees that were uprooted by the road yesterday were the monster. Although I was more and more scared, I couldn&rsquo;t help looking at it. At this time, the giant was getting closer and closer, and Ying Qiong looked more carefully. I saw that this monster was born with people, and it was really scary: a big head, about the size of a large water tank. A pair of large bowls of big eyes, sparkling green light. The concave nose is facing the sky, two feet long. The big mouth of the blood basin exposed four teeth, and it was staggered up and down. One blue hair, two longee long feet, a few feet long, and the thick circle is about a few feet. Both hands are as big as screens. There is a yellow hair all over and down, with a few inches. From head to toe, I am afraid that there are no dozens of feet. Ying Qiong could see God and almost forgot to be afraid. Suddenly, there was a dark eyes, a strange and pungent, and the monster had approached the cave. The hole in the hole was all knee, and the light outside was covered by its body, so it was dark. Ying Qiong felt that when the stone moved, he knew that the crisis had been forced and dared not neglect. I just brought my body, and suddenly heard a loud noise beside my ears, and the eyes were bright in front of my eyes, knowing that the cave stones had been removed by monsters. In a hurry to the hidden place, secretly looking out with his eyes, I saw the head of the monster just seen at the entrance of the cave, and his eyes made a green light, and he laughed at Ying Qiong&rsquo;s teeth. I was so scared that Ying Qiong was lying aside, and she didn&rsquo;t even dare to breathe. Fortunately, the head and body of the monster were too big to get in, and only for a moment, they retreated. After a while, there was another big screen, two or three feet long arms, and opened his five fingers as thick as beef legs and about a few feet long. Just frightened Ying Qiong&rsquo;s heartbroken, hurriedly put her body, from the fingers of the big hair, to the left corner of the cave. The big hair grabbed an empty hand, and grabbed his hand randomly. At this time, Yingqiong was not afraid of fear. Fortunately, she was thin and small, and she only got into the gap in the big hand. The monster was fishing for a long time, and suddenly the hair exited. If you want to know, please see it.</p>
